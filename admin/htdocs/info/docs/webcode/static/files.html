<h1>File locations and links</h1>

<p>The Ensembl webcode now parses certain areas of the static content to enable 
automation creation of navigation links. It is therefore essential that you 
do not put content in the wrong place!</p>

<p>Points to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anything within an <kbd>htdocs/info/</kbd> folder in <strong>any</strong> plugin 
will be automagically added to the documentation sitemap</li> 

<li>For the sake of other projects using the Ensembl webcode, please do not place
documentation in the top level <kbd>/htdocs/info/</kbd> directory</li>

<li>Permanent, public documentation about Ensembl belongs in 
<kbd>public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/</kbd></li>

<li>Temporary information that we want all visitors to be able to find (e.g. job ads)
should go in <kbd>sanger-plugins/sanger/htdocs/info/</kbd></li>

<li>Information that we want to make available to the wider world but not link to directly 
(e.g. temporary information about workshops) should go in 
</kbd>sanger-plugins/sanger/htdocs/pages/</kbd></li> 

<li>Before adding a page to a plugin, please check if there is an existing folder hierarchy 
in <kbd>htdocs</kbd> or <kbd>public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs</kbd>, as this will help to keep 
related content together. For example, if you need to post a temporary page about extra data 
that can be downloaded in this release, a good place to put it is in 
<kbd>sanger-plugins/sanger/htdocs/info/downloads/</kbd>, as the link will then be added to the 
'Data Downloads' section of the sitemap alongside the content from 
<kbd>public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/downloads/</kbd> </li>

<li>Please do not make relative links to articles outside the content you control, e.g. 
'../../about/contact.html', as these links are hard to trace when they break. Instead 
use absolute links from the top of the document tree, e.g. '/info/about/contact.html' 
(relative links to files in the same directory or in subdirectories are OK). </li>

<li>Please do not hard-code links to www.ensembl.org unless there is a pressing reason, 
as it can cause problems in archives</li> 
</ul>
