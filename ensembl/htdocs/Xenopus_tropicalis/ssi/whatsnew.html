<h4><i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> News</h4><ul class="spaced">
<li><strong>New Xenopus assembly and genebuild</strong><br />Ensembl <i>X.tropicalis</i> has been updated to the 4.0 assembly of June 2005, and a new set of gene predictions created based on both <i>X.tropicalis</i> and <i>X.laevis</i> proteins.</li>
<li><strong>Projected gene names</strong><br /><p>Gene names have been projected across orthologues in the form.<br /><a href="/Multi/newsview?rel=37#item605">Read more</a>...
</li>
<li><strong>UniProt updates</strong><br /> Support has been added for variable splice UniProt records by adding an external db with a display label of  "UniprotKB/SpliceVariant" to the external_db table on all databases.<br /><a href="/Multi/newsview?rel=37#item603">Read more</a>...
</li>
<li><strong>Bug fix to Transcript.pm</strong><br />Transcript.pm; is_known() was returning true if the 
transcript had a display_xref set, which is both incorrect and 
inconsistent with the is_known() method in Gene.pm. The new behaviour is to return true if the transcript's status is KNOWN.</li>
<li><strong>Change to xref.display_label field</strong><br />The width of xref.display_label has been extended to 128 characters to cope with the longer labels produced by gene name & GO term projection.</li>
