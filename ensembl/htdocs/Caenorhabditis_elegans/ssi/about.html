<h3 class="boxed">About the <i>C. elegans</i> genome</h3>

<h4>Assembly and Annotation</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Caenorhabditis_elegans.png" width="100" height="65" alt="C. elegans" class="float-left" />The data on this site is a direct import of the Wormbase 150 dataset. Although no additional genebuild was carried out, a series of blast runs 
was done to provide ESTs, Uniprot and Unigene hits, and other similarity 
data. Cross references to identifiers in other databases were also 
generated. New in this release are cross references to GO. </p>
    
<p>We have included <i>C.elegans</i> into the Ensembl system to allow people
    to access the data through the Ensembl user interface (both
    for visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species
    integration throught our comparative genomics resources (such as
    homologous gene links and protein family/domain pages).</p>

<p>The canonical data for <i>C. elegans</i> is managed at <a href="http://www.wormbase.org">Wormbase</a>.</p>
