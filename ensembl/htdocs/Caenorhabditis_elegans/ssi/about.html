The data on this site is a direct import of the WormBase 180 frozen  
dataset. Included are annotated operons, genes, transcripts and cds's  
as well as RNAi and BLAST/BLAT homology data. Information about the  
location of available fosmid clones is also included.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ws180.wormbase.org">WS180 dataset</a> is the 9th frozen release of WormBase 
<i>C.elegans</i>  data. All data used in the frozen releases is available from the
<a href="ftp.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/data_freezes/">WormBase FTP site</a> and links to permanent  
websites can be found on the <a href="http://www.wormbase.org">WormBase home page</a>.</p>

<p>We have included <i>C.elegans</i> in the Ensembl system to allow people to  
access the data through the Ensembl user interface (both for  
visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species  
integration through our comparative genomics resources (such as  
homologous gene links and protein family pages).</p>
