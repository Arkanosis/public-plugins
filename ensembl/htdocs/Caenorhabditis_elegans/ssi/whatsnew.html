<h4><i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> News</h4><ul class="spaced">
<li><strong>Import of Wormbase 150</strong><br />Ensembl <i>C.elegans</i> has been updated with an import of the Wormbase release of November 2005. New data includes orthologous relationships identified by the InParanoid algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>UniProt updates</strong><br /> Support has been added for variable splice UniProt records by adding an external db with a display label of  "UniprotKB/SpliceVariant" to the external_db table on all databases.<br /><a href="/Multi/newsview?rel=37#item603">Read more</a>...
</li>
<li><strong>Bug fix to Transcript.pm</strong><br />Transcript.pm; is_known() was returning true if the 
transcript had a display_xref set, which is both incorrect and 
inconsistent with the is_known() method in Gene.pm. The new behaviour is to return true if the transcript's status is KNOWN.</li>
<li><strong>Change to xref.display_label field</strong><br />The width of xref.display_label has been extended to 128 characters to cope with the longer labels produced by gene name & GO term projection.</li>
<li><strong>Gene and peptide archive</strong><br />The peptide and gene archive schema has been updated and
the API modified appropriately.</li>
