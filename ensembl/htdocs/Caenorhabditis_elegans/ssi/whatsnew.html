<li><strong>Projections of gene names and GO terms</strong><br />These have been done as usual, between a variety of species.</li>
<li><strong>Stored peptide stats</strong><br />In order to improve efficiency on ProtView, peptide statistics are now calculated in advance and stored as translation attributes, instead of being calculated on the fly.</li>
