<h4>Assembly</h4>

The genome of a single <i>Ciona savignyi</i> from San Francisco Bay was shotgun-sequenced by the Broad Institute and assembled using Arachne2. The Sidow lab at Stanford used this as a basis for the assembly <a href="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/ciona.html" rel="external">[details]</a>.</p>

<p>
  The assembly consists of 374 Reftigs, totalling 174 Megabases, with a Contig N50 of 141Kb and Reftig N50 size of 1800Kb.

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>The standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline was modified for annotation of 
the <i>Ciona savignyi</i> genome, owing to the lack of genomic information from 
closely-related species. Thus, in addition to aligning known Ciona 
proteins to the sequence (as per the standard pipeline), we aligned 
Ciona-specific cDNA and EST sequences against the genome, and then used 
these in conjunction with protein data from other species to build 
additional gene models.</p>
