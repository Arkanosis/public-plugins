Btau_3.1 is a preliminary assembly of the cow, Bos taurus, Hereford
breed. The Btau_3.1 assembly used a combined strategy as developed for
the rat genome (Nature 428:493-521). The combined strategy is a hybrid
of the Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) approach used for the mouse genome and
the hierarchical (BAC clone) approach used for the human genome. The
sequencing combines BAC shotgun reads with whole-genome-shotgun (WGS)
reads from small insert libraries as well as BAC end sequences. The
project coordination and genome sequencing and assembly is provided by
the <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/bovine/">Human Genome
Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine</a></p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the contigs is 48.7 kb
and the N50 of the scaffolds is 997.5 kb. The total length of all
contigs is 2.73 Gb. When the gaps between contigs in scaffolds are
included, the total span of the assembly is 2.87 Gb. The coverage is 7x.
