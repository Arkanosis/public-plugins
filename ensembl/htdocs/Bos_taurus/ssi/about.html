<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Bos_taurus.png" height="80" width="80" class="float-left" alt="Cow" title="">
Btau_2.0 is a preliminary assembly of the cow, <i>Bos taurus</i>, Hereford
breed, using whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads from small insert clones
and BAC end sequences. The project coordination and genome sequencing and
assembly is provided by the Human Genome Sequencing Center at 
<a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/">Baylor College of Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>The Btau_2.0 release was produced by assembling whole genome shotgun
reads with the Atlas genome assembly system. Several WGS libraries, with
inserts of 2-4 kb, and 4-6 kb, were used to produce the data. About 23
million reads were assembled, representing about 17.7 Gb of sequence
and about 6.2x coverage of the (clonable) bovine genome.

<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the contigs is 18.9 kb
and the N50 of the scaffolds is 434.7 kb. The total length of all contigs
is 2.62 Gb. When the gaps between contigs in scaffolds are included, the
total span of the assembly is 3.1 Gb.

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>The improved, 6x assembly of cow has made it possible to apply a 
classical Ensembl gene-build to determine the gene-set</p>
