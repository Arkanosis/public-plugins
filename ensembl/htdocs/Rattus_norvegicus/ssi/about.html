<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Rattus_norvegicus.png" height="75" width="140" class="float-left" alt="Rat" title="eeeeek! eeeek!" />The latest build provides a preliminary data set based on the version 3.4 "November 2004 Update" of the rat genome assembly. In this update a 15 bp overhang was removed at the join between AABR03100354-AC117058 and the order was reversed for BACs AC133000 and AC136926. </p>
    
<p>The Rat Genome project is an international collaboration to sequence
	the genome of the brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>).  The DNA
	sequence is generated by <a

	Medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.celera.com">Celera Genomics</a>, <a
	href="http://www.genomecorp.com">Genome Therapeutics</a>, <a
	href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/bac_ends/rat/bac_end_intro.html">The
	Institute for Genome Research</a>, and <a

	Columbia</a>.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<div class="notice">
<h4>Notice to users</h4>
<p>Please be aware of the fact that the data set is
preliminary and may change in a few instances. Genotype data for
the GK/Ox, Buf/Mna, and AUG/OlaHsd strains will be updated and
should be retrieved from the final data set that will be released
in October.</p>
</div>

<p>Ensembl is working with the broader rat genomics community (<a
	href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/">RGD</a>) to provide annotation of the rat
	genome. The latest release (August 2006) uses a new rat-specific repeat library, 
and takes advantage of additional cDNAs and ESTs which have been published since 
the original RGSC 3.4 genebuild, with the result that around 1800 new gene predictions 
have been added. </p>
