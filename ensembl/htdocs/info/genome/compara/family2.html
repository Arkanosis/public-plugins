  <h1>Gene Families in Compara</h1>

  <p>
  Ensembl families are determined through clustering of all Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes 
  proteins along with metazoan sequences from <a rel="external" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/">UniProtKB</a>.
  It therefore provides a way of exploring orthologues and closely related homologues across a range of animal species.

  <h2 id="EnsemblProteinFamilyMembers">Ensembl Protein Family Report</h2>

  <p>The pipeline consists of the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
	<li>Load members from Ensembl</li>
	<li>Load UniProt entries</li>
	<li>Run HMM search (using the HMM library described in this <a rel="external" href="hmm_lib.html">document</a>)</li>
	<li>Store the families</li>
	<li>Align the families with Mafft</li>
	<li>Annotate the family with a consensus description (from its members' descriptions)</li>
  </ol>
