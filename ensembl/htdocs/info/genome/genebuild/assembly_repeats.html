<h1 id="repeats">Repeats</h1>

<p>Repetitive sequence is found throughout genomes. It is important to mask repeats before gene annotation, as repeats will cause non-specific gene hits. Repeats are also useful for studying evolution and for DNA fingerprinting.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Repeat type</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Centromere</td>
<td>The region of the chromosome at which the two sister chromatids are joined during mitosis and meiosis, mostly composed of satellite DNA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low complexity regions</td>
<td>Poly-purine or poly-pyrimidine stretches, or regions of extremely high AT or GC content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RNA repeats</td>
<td>Non-functional copies of RNA genes which have been reintegrated into the genome with the assistance of a reverse transcriptase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Satellite repeats</td>
<td>Multiple copies of the same base sequence on a DNA sequence. The repeated pattern can vary in length from a single base to several thousand bases long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Simple repeats</td>
<td>Duplications of simple sets of DNA bases (typically 1-5bp) such as A, CA, CGG etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tandem repeats</td>
<td>Typically found at the centromeres and telomeres of chromosomes these are duplications of more complex 100-200 base sequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LTRs</td>
<td>Long tandem repeats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Type I Transposons/LINE</td>
<td>Long Interspersed Elements. Retrotransposed elements in the genome containing open reading frames encoding (often inactive) reverse transcription machinery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Type I Transposons/SINE</td>
<td>Short Interspersed Elements. Retrotransposed elements less than 500 bp that contain tRNA, snRNA and rRNA, which require other mobile elements to be transposed. Alu elements are a type of SINE.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Type II Transposons</td>
<td>Elements that have been transposed and duplicated around the genome by excision and ligation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>Repeats that cannot be classified.</td>
</tr>

<h2 id="maskingtherepeats">Masking the repeats</h2>

<p>Ensembl mask repeats using <a href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/">Repeat Masker</a> and <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16796549">Dust</a>.</p>

<p>Repeats can be viewed in the browser and extracted using our APIs. You can also download repeat-masked sequence from our FTP site, either hard-masked (rm) where repeats are replaced with Ns, or soft-masked (sm) where repeats are in lower-case text.</p>
