<h1>Annotation of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes</h1>

<p>The Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (Tcr) genes are present in germ-line genomic DNA. They comprise the four segment types, variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C), which are rearranged and brought together by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D)J_recombination">VDJ recombination</a> to form functional Ig and Tcr genes during B-cell and T-cell maturation. This results in genetically different B-cells and T-cells, which encode different proteins to recognise specific antigens as part of the acquired immune system.</p>

<p>The protein and nucleotide databases contain many sequences of mature Ig/Tcr genes. Inferring gene structures by aligning these to the genome using the standard Ensembl annotation process pipeline gives unsatisfactory results, for two main reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The non-coding DNA that separates pairs of gene segments brought together by V-D-J recombination is not an intron, and the gene boundaries display different sequence signals to splice sites. Spliced alignment programs such as <a href="http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC479130">GeneWise</a> therefore require retuning in order to predict the gene structure correctly.</p></li>

<li><p>Some genes comprise multiple exons. Delineating a "spliced" alignment of a mature Ig/Tcr sequence to the genome into its constituent segments is therefore not straightforward.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="annotationofigtcrgenes">Annotation of Ig/Tcr genes</h2>

<p>For this reason, Ig/Tcr gene segments have been annotated differently to other Ensembl genes. Ensembl makes use of the <a href="http://www.imgt.org/">IMGT</a> database, which provides annotation of individual gene segments on reference sequences. Ensembl use a combination of manual annotation by <a href="/info/genome/genebuild/manual_havana.html">Havana</a> and automatic annotation by extracting individual gene sequences and aligning them to the genome using the <a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15713233">Exonerate</a> alignment tool for Ig/Tcr genes.</p>

<p>To reflect their role in the VDJ recombination process, segments are annotated as belonging to one of four classes: V, D, J and C. At present, Ensembl Ig/Tcr gene annotations are only available for human and mouse.</p>
