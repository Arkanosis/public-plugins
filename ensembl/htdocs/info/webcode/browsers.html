<h2>Supported Browsers</h2>

<h3>Fully supported</h3>
<p>The following browsers are fully supported, i.e. all site features including
JavaScript and CSS styles should work properly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox - all versions</li>
<li>Mozilla 1/Netscape 6 (and higher) - all versions</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 5.0 (and higher) for Windows</li>
<li>Camino - Mac</li>
<li>Safari - Mac</li>
<li>Opera 7 (and higher) - all versions</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" title="Get Firefox!">Firefox</a> for browsing Ensembl.</p>

<h3>Mostly supported</h3>
<p>In some browsers, all content is available but rendering of a few elements is buggy. 
In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IE5 for Mac</strong> has some CSS layout bugs, so that for example,
columns of text may be rendered one below another instead of side-by-side.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Microsoft has withdrawn support of IE5 for Mac, and they now recommend
using an alternative browser on OS X, such as Safari or Firefox.</p>

<h3>Minimally supported</h3>
<p>Older browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4 should be able to display most 
pages in their basic form (albeit without colours or columnar layout) but some 
elements will not work, e.g. JavaScript popup menus. 
There are no plans to further support these obsolete browsers.</p>
