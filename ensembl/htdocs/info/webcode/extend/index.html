<h2 class="breadcrumbs">Customizing and Extending Ensembl</h2>

<p>
The Ensembl webcode is designed to extensible, so that other projects
can customize their own installation without their changes being
overwritten when they update to a new release.
</p>

<p>The Ensembl system of plugins allow a range of customizations:</p>
<ul class="spaced">
<li>The <code>public-plugins/mirror</code> plugin enables you to apply your own server
settings (domain name, admin email address, database names and passwords)
to a standard install of Ensembl</li>
<li>You can further use this plugin to operate a cut-down version of Ensembl
with fewer species</li>
<li>By creating your own plugin, you can completely change the available
species, alter the colour scheme or page template, or add your own views 
and static content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some tutorials on customizing your site are given below - if you have any 
further questions, please do contact us via the development 
<a href="/info/about/mailing.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

<div class="notice"><strong>Important note</strong>: Regardless of any changes you may
make to your Ensembl website, you <em>must</em> check out all the 
api code, as it is not pluggable. The core API will not work if you
do not have compara, variation and funcgen APIs as well.</div>

<h3 class="boxed">More About Plugins</h3>

<p>Plugins are used to complement the normal system of inheritance in 
object-oriented Perl. Whereas a child object can inherit methods
from multiple parents, a parent object normally cannot be overridden by
multiple children. The plugin system "aggregates" the contents
of several methods into one "master" method that can then be used by
mod_perl when rendering the webpage.</p>

<p>The module <code>conf/Plugins.pm</code> controls which plugins are
used by an instance of Ensembl and their order of precedence. In a 
standard Ensembl mirror, the module will define a plugin array as follows:</p>

<pre>
$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_PLUGINS = [
  'EnsEMBL::Mirror'    =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/mirror',
  'EnsEMBL::Ensembl'   =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/ensembl'
];
</pre>

<p>The plugins are processed in reverse order, starting with the last one:</p>

<dl>
<dt>/public-plugins/ensembl</dt>
<dd>This is the plugin used by www.ensembl.org to add all Ensembl species
and site-specific content to the base code</dd>
<dt>/public-plugins/mirror</dt>
<dd>This plugin over-rides /public-plugins/ensembl - normally it is used only 
to configure local server settings</dd>
</dl>
