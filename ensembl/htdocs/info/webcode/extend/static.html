<h2>Adding Static Content to your Ensembl website</h2>

<p>The public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info directory contains all the
documentation needed for an Ensembl mirror. If however you are setting
up a site with your own species, you may want to add your own pages, 
such as contact information for your project or general documentation
that applies to all species.</p>

<h3 class="boxed">Navigation</h3>

<p>In order to avoid spending time maintaining navigation of static
pages, the Ensembl code includes automated navigation. This is implemented
as follows:</p>

<ol class="spaced">
<li>At server startup, the module EnsEMBL::Web::SpeciesDefs parses the
entire document tree for htdocs/info/ in all plugins, to produce a
combined tree for the whole site</li>
<li>This tree is then used to generate site navigation:
  <ul class="spaced">
  <li>The main sitemap (a static HTML page generated using a perl script)
includes an expandable version of the document tree</li>
  <li>On each static page, a "breadcrumb trail" is constructed from the
relevant path through the tree</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to take advantage of this functionality, you simply need to make
sure that you place your documentation in the htdocs/info directory of your
plugin, and follow these simple rules when formatting your HTML files:</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li>Use the file extension .html - other file types are ignored</li>
<li>Use XHTML in preference to HTML</li>
<li>Omit templating and navigation - that is all handled by the web code</li>
<li>Include a &lt;title&gt; tag</li>
<li>On index pages, if the title is longer than a couple of words, consider using
a "navigation" meta tag (see below)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sample file:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;About This Project&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta name="navigation" content="About" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;About This Project&lt;/h1&gt;

[Your content here]

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</div>

<h4>Omitting content from the navigation</h4>

<p>There may be instances where you do not wish to have SpeciesDefs parse sections of the tree.
For example, we do not include the contents of 'Pdocs' in the Ensembl documentation tree as it
contains many hundreds of files and has its own navigation menu.</p>

<p>To omit part or all of a directory from the tree, use the "index" meta tag as follows:</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li>To omit an entire directory, put the "index" meta tag in the index.html file header
and set its value to "NO INDEX"</li>
<li>To include the index file but not other HTML files or subdirectories, put the "index" 
meta tag in the index.html file and set its value to "NO FOLLOW"</li>
<li>To omit an individual HTML file, put the "index" meta tag in its header and
set the value to "NO INDEX"</li>
</ul> 

<p>N.B. Directories with no index.html file are omitted automatically, as it is assumed they
exist purely to aid in organising the files.</p>

<p>Sample file:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;PDoc Documentation&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta name="navigation" content="Pdocs" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="index" content="NO FOLLOW" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ensembl PDoc Documentation&lt;/h1&gt;
