  <h2>Issues installing Ensembl Website</h2>

<h3 class="boxed"><a name="whichfile">Which configuration files do I edit?</a></h3>
<p>
  Ensembl contains a number of ini-files with the same name - why?
</p>
<p>
  Ensembl uses a system of "plugins" to make site configuration and extension
  easier. These are listed in conf/Plugins - generally only the top one, which
  configures your mirror, should be edited. Leave the others alone, as they
   will only be overwritten next time you update the Ensembl webcode.
</p>

<h3 class="boxed"><a name="accounts">The main Ensembl website has user accounts - can we enable them on our mirror?</a></h3>
<p>
  To enable accounts set the following to your SiteDefs.pm:
</p>
<pre>
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_LOGINS                 = 1;
</pre>

<p>Also make sure that your mail server name and mail command are set correctly,
otherwise your users will not receive their activation emails, group invitations, etc.</p>

<p>Note that you will need a MySQL server to store user account information - SQLite is not 
supported for user accounts.</p>

<h3 class="boxed"><a name="sqlite">Configurations are not stored if I don't have a local MySQL server?</h3>
<p>
  If you to not need to install a local MySQL server (because you are pointing to the ensembldb.ensembl.org databases,
  then you can use SQLite. Install SQLite as outlined in the non-Ensembl code page and then include the SQLite plugin in your conf/Plugins.pm file. <strong>NOTE:</strong> only session storage (not user/group) is supported in this case.
