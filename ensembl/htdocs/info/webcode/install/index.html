  <h2>Ensembl Website Installation Instructions - Version [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]</h2>
<p>These pages provide step-by-step instructions for installing your own version of the Ensembl web
site. They are intended to be complete; that is, if you install the site simply by following these
instructions, it should work.</p>

<p>If you need to customize your Ensembl installation in any way, we recommend you install a
normal Ensembl website first and then experiment with 
<a href="/info/webcode/extend/">customization options</a>.</p>

<p>This document is updated with each new release. If you find any omissions, errors, or just 
confusing bits in the instructions, please send an email to
<a href="mailto:ensembl-webteam@sanger.ac.uk">ensembl-webteam@sanger.ac.uk</a>, and we'll try 
to fix things.</p>

  <dt>Mart isn't currently installed in the Ensembl mirror. How can I enable it?</dt>
