  <h3 class="boxed">About Archive Ensembl</h3>

<p><img src="/img/generic-archive-roundel.gif" alt="Archive_ensembl" class="float-left" height="120" width="120" />The main Ensembl site <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">www.ensembl.org</a> is updated with the latest data on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The Ensembl Archive sites have been set up so there is a stable link 
for at least two years to pages from a particular release (e.g. version 26 from 
November 2004) in Ensembl.</p>

<p>These links will be suitable for referring to Ensembl pages in publications.</p>

<p>A selection of older archives are being maintained, but the availability of these 
sites cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>For all enquiries, please <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/about/contact.html">contact the Ensembl HelpDesk</a> (<a href="mailto:helpdesk@ensembl.org">helpdesk@ensembl.org</a>). </p>
