<h3 class="boxed">Linking to the Archive Ensembl sites</h3>

<p>The Archive Ensembl sites,
(<i>e.g. http://Nov2004.archive.ensembl.org</i>), have the format:
<kbd>http://&lt;three-letter-month&gt;&lt;year&gt;.archive.ensembl.org</kbd>
</p>


<p>In the lefthand (yellow) column of each <a href="http://www.ensembl.org" target="_blank">current Ensembl</a> page, there is a
link called 'Stable archive link to this page', which links to the
corresponding permanent page in the Ensembl Archive. A similar link on each
archive page links back to the current site (i.e. www.ensembl.org). Note that
prior to the site redesign in Version 32, return links from the archive were
in the form of a graphical button at the foot of the page.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <br />
If you are looking at the MapView page for human chromosome 1 on the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">main Ensembl site</a> in November 2004 when Ensembl 26 was the current version, the URL would be:</p>
<kbd><a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/mapview?chr=1">http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/mapview?chr=1</a> </kbd>

<p>and the equivalent archived page URL would be:</p>
<kbd><a href="http://nov2004.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/mapview?chr=1">http://Nov2004.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/mapview?chr=1</a></kbd>
