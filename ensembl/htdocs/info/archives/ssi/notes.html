<h3 class="boxed">Notes</h3>

<ul class="spaced">
<li>Ensembl aims to maintain stable identifiers for genes (ENSG), 
transcripts (ENST), proteins (ENSP) and exons (ENSE) as long as possible. 
Changes  within the genome sequence assembly or an updated genome 
annotation may dramatically change a gene model. In these cases, the old 
set of stable IDs is retired and a new one assigned.</li>

<li>Ensembl protein family identifiers (ENSF), EST gene indentifiers
(ENSESTG) and Genscan identifiers (GENSCAN) are currently not stable.</li>

<li>DAS sources are not archived so any shown are current data.</li>

<li><a href="http://pre.ensembl.org/">Pre-site</a> species are not listed in the archive sites as these change more frequently.</li>

<li>BLAST and SSAHA are not currently available from the archive site.</li>
