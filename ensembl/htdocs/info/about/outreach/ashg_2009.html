<h1>Ensembl Interactive Workshop</h1>


<p>Paul Flicek and Xose Fernandez from the European Bioinformatics Institute will present an interactive workshop on Ensembl in the <a href="http://www.ashg.org/2009meeting/">59th Annual Meeting of The American Society of Human Genetics</a> (ASHG) next Friday 23rd October at noon [Room 315, Convention Center].</p>

<p>Requirements: You must bring your laptop (make sure your battery is fully charged) and your computer should have a wireless card to be able to participate. For questions about the workshop, contact Xose Fernandez at <a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Interactive Workshop, Friday 23 from 12.00-13.00</h2>

<p>Ensembl provides an infrastructure for genomic information, from its storage through to analysis and visualisation. This workshop offers participants the possibility of gaining hands-on experience in the use of the Ensembl genome browser providing the necessary background information.</p>

<p>Ensembl uses data from ENCODE and other genome-wide functional datasets to produce and display more integrated views of genome function. These functional elements may harbour more variants than protein coding sequences opening new ways of exploring the relationship between variation and function.</p>

<p>By attending this interactive wireless workshop you will learn about databases, the Ensembl Genome Browser and data mining with BioMart that help scientists understand the human and 48 other animal genomes. There is no cost to attend the workshop but you must <a href="http://www.ashg.org/2009meeting/pages/registration.shtml">register for the ASHG 2009 meeting</a> (please check the appropriate box on the registration form). Seating is limited so please help us registering before the workshop.</p>

<p>We will also be present in booth 432 (with our colleagues from DECIPHER) so please come along to learn more about Ensembl or to ask us any questions - your suggestions are always welcome.</p>
