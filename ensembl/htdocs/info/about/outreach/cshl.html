<h1>Ensembl Developers' Workshop 2008</h1>

<p>Ensembl announces a workshop for developers that will take place at the 
Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton in September (Sunday 14th - Monday 16th), 
following the Genome Informatics meeting.</p>

<p>As this workshop is aimed at developers, we will be exploring Ensembl 
beyond using the website. Participants will be expected to have 
experience in writing Perl programs and a background in object oriented 
programming techniques. Familiarity with databases (MySQL) would be 
an advantage.</p>

<p>Several Ensembl developers will present sessions on how to create your own resources 
based on our APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and how to extend the 
Ensembl system.</p>

<p>The course will start Sunday afternoon and finish on Tuesday at lunch time, 
and will be in the IT Training Room at the EBI.</p>

<p>At the end of this course, attendees will</p>

<ul>
<li>have a good understanding of Ensembl's annotation pipeline;</li>
<li>know how to customise a local installation of the Ensembl website;</li>
<li>and have hands-on experience with the annotation pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no registration fee to attend this course, but you will have to 
register. To register your interest to attend send an email to Xos&eacute; M.
