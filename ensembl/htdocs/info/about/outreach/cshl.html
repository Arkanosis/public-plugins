<h1>Ensembl Developers' Workshop at Genome Informatics 2009</h1>

<p>Ensembl announces a workshop for developers that will take place at the
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). The workshop runs from
Friday 30th October until Sunday 1st November, following the
Genome Informatics meeting.</p> 

<p>As this workshop is aimed at developers, we will be exploring Ensembl 
beyond using the website. Participants will be expected to have 
experience in programming and a background in object oriented 
programming techniques. Familiarity with Perl, a Unix/Linux environment, databases 
and structured query languages (MySQL) are needed to follow the workshop
and the programming examples. We would like to point out that this is not
a 'learning how to program in Perl' workshop.</p>

<p>Several Ensembl developers will present sessions on how to create your own resources 
based on our <a href="/info/docs/Pdoc/">APIs</a> (Application Programming Interfaces) 
and how to extend the Ensembl system.</p>

<p>The course will start Friday afternoon and finish on Sunday around lunch time, 
and will most likely be in the IT Training Room.</p>

<p>The workshop will be given by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bronwen Aken (Ensembl Genome Annotation team)</li>
<li>Jan-Hinnerk Vogel (Ensembl Genome Annotation team)</li>
<li>Paul Kersey (Ensembl Genomes)</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of this course, attendees will</p>

<ul>
<li>have a good understanding of Ensembl's annotation pipeline;</li>
<li>know how to customise a local installation of the Ensembl website;</li>
<li>and have hands-on experience with the annotation pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no registration fee to attend this course, but we ask you to register
in advance because the number of attendees is limited by the size of the training venue.
Please note that the workshop runs after the conference (Friday 30th October - Sunday 1st 
November), so don't forget to arrange additional accommodation for the workshop days.</p> 

<p>We (Bron and Jan) are currently reviewing the content of the 'standard workshop' 
we've presented in earlier years (2008). If you have any topics which you would like 
to explore further, please let us know. If enough interest, we will offer an 'Ensembl 
Solexa Special' module, which will include the mapping of short-read data to genomes 
which have been annotated in Ensembl. Please let us know if you are interested in this.</p>

<p>To register your interest to attend send an email to Xos&eacute; M. 
Fern&aacute;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), with your details.</p>

<p>We will circulate an agenda amongst participants.</p>

<p>We are grateful to CSHL for their help in organising this course.</p>
