<h1>Ensembl Interactive Workshop - Human Variome Project</h1>


<p>The Ensembl team will host an interactive workshop in the <a 
href="http://www.humanvariomeproject.org/meetings/paris/ebi.html">3rd 
Human Variome Project Meeting</a> on Monday 10th May in Paris. </p>

<p>The Ensembl project provides a comprehensive and integrated source of 
annotation of mainly vertebrate genome sequences. With this workshop we 
offer participants the possibility of gaining lots of hands-on 
experience in the use of the Ensembl genome browser, providing them with 
the necessary background information. Thus, we would encourage 
participants to come with their own questions so that we can address 
them in the surgery time or throughout the day.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>you must bring your laptop, which should 
have a wireless card, to be able to participate. To register, go the <a

<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>A fee of 50&euro; will be charged to cover costs, which include morning 
and afternoon coffee breaks and lunch in the UNESCO cafeteria. Please note 
that places are limited, so please book early to avoid disappointment.</p>
