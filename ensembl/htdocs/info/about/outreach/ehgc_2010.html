<h1>European Human Genetics Conference 2010 Satellite Meeting</h1>
<h2>Browsing Genes and Genomes with Ensembl</h2>

<p><em>Bert Overduin, Ph.D.<br />
EMBL - European Bioinformatics Institute<br />
Hinxton, Cambridge, UK</em></p>

<p>The Ensembl team is happy to offer a 1-day hands-on Ensembl genome browser 
workshop to participants of the European Human Genetics Conference 2010 in 
Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

<h2>Time</h2>

<p>Friday 11 June 2010, 09:30 - 17:00.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>

<p>Gothenburg University (detailed location will be provided upon registration).</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>The workshop is free, but as space is limited to 30 participants you need to 
register by mailing <a href="mailto:bert@ebi.ac.uk">Bert Overduin</a>.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Ensembl project provides a comprehensive and integrated source of annotation 
of, mainly vertebrate, genome sequences. This 1-day workshop offers participants the 
possibility of gaining lots of hands-on experience in the use of the Ensembl genome 
browser but also provides them with the necessary background information. The workshop 
is primarily targeted at wetlab researchers.</p>

<p>The workshop consists of the following modules. Most modules consist of a presentation, 
followed by the opportunity to do exercises.</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to Ensembl: origin, goals and organization of the Ensembl project</li>
<li>Worked example: guided tour of the most important pages of the Ensembl website</li>
<li>Data mining with BioMart: retrieving complex / large datasets using the data mining 
tool BioMart</li>
<li>The Ensembl genebuild: how are Ensembl gene and transcripts models made?</li>
<li>Variation: SNPs, copy number variation</li>
<li>Comparative genomics: orthologues and paralogues, protein families, whole genome 
alignments and syntenic regions</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants are encouraged to bring problems/questions about their research to try to 
tackle these during the workshop using Ensembl.</p>

<p>The only prerequisite for this workshop is general knowledge of molecular biology / 
genomics and a familiarity with web browsers.</p>
