<h1>Using rsync to download from the FTP site</h1>

<p>If you require large amounts of data or are having problems with network connectivity,
you may find it more convenient to use rsync for your downloads.</p>

<p>You will need to visit the <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/" rel="external">Ensembl FTP site</a> 
in your web browser to locate the files you need, then just copy the URL into the 
command line. For example, the following command will download all the human EMBL files 
to the current directory:</p>

<pre class="code">
rsync -av  rsync://ftp.ensembl.org/ensembl/pub/current_embl/homo_sapiens .
</pre>
