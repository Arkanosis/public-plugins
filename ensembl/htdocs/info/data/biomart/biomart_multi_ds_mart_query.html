<h2>How to link two Ensembl mart species datasets together</h2>
<p>The BioMart interface allow you to link two different species datasets together to create a join query. First, go to the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview">Ensembl biomart page</a>. In the image below, I'am fetching all the Ensembl Gene and Transcript IDs, HGNC IDs and symbols located on the human chromosome 1.</p>

<p>Click on the second "Dataset" button indicated by the first red arrow in the image below.</p>
<p><div class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/img/link_biomart_ds2.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></div></p>
<p>You will noticed a new dropdown (indicated by the second arrow in the image above), click on it to select the second species dataset that you are interested in.</p>
<p>In this example, I will select mouse in the dropdown as indicated by the red arrow in the image below.</p>
<p><div class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/img/link_biomart_ds3.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></div></p>
<p>Finally, I will fetch all the Ensembl Gene and Transcript IDs, MGI IDs and symbols located on the mouse chromosome 1. Click on the result page. You can see on the image below that the red box represent the human attributes selected in the first dataset and the green box the mouse attributes selected in the second dataset.</p>

<h2>How to query two different Ensembl marts at the same time</h2>
<p>The BioMart interface allow you to go further and query species datasets present in two different marts.</p>
First, go to the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview">Ensembl biomart page</a>. In the image below, I'am fetching all the Ensembl Gene and Transcript IDs, HGNC IDs and symbols located on the human chromosome 1.</p>
<p><div class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/img/link_biomart_ds1.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></div></p>
<p>Click on the second "Dataset" button indicated by the first red arrow in the image below.</p>
<p><div class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/img/link_biomart_ds2.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></div></p>
<p>You will noticed a new dropdown (indicated by the second arrow in the image above), click on it to select the second species dataset in the second mart that you are interested in.</p>
<p>In this example, I will select the human short variation in the dropdown as indicated by the red arrow in the image below.</p>
<p><div class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="/img/link_marts1.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></div></p>
<p>Finally, I will fetch all the Variation Names, sources and descriptions, Variant Alleles and Minor alleles (ALL) located on the human chromosome 1. Click on the result page. You can see on the image below that the red box represent the human attributes selected in the Ensembl gene mart and the green box the human short variation attributes selected in the Ensembl Variation mart.</p>
