<h1>External References Tables</h1>

<p>
Ensembl supports the link of external database entries to internal objects. 
This is done on translation and transcript objects, and may be done on genes in the future.
An external entry is described in the <a href="schema_description.html#xref">xref</a> table and the database it comes from in the <a href="schema_description.html#external_db">external_db</a> table.
Any synonyms for the external entry are stored in <a href="schema_description.html#external_synonym">external_synonym</a>.
</p>

<p>Links to Ensembl are in the <a href="schema_description.html#object_xref">object_xref</a> table.
Some links need additional information (attached to the link and not the external entry).
Derived GO identifiers are qualified by the way they were derived (<a href="schema_description.html#go_xref">go_xref</a>.linkage_type).
External links that are derived from aligned peptides are annotated with the alignment details in <a href="schema_description.html#identity_xref">identity_xref</a>.
