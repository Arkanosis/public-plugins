<h1>Archive Tables</h1>

<p>
The archive related tables keep track of stable identifiers in Ensembl. 
Genes in Ensembl change with every new release and gene build of the assembly. 
This can mean a change of stable identifier. 
The <a href="schema_description.html#mapping_session">mapping_session</a> table stores any entry changes.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="schema_description.html#gene_archive">gene_archive</a> table stores gene structures. 
Whenever a stable id for a gene gets a new version or disappears from the database, the table records the transcripts and translations structure of the gene. 
Theoretically the gene_version should provide enough information about the archived gene, but if the version of the gene was not kept up to date,  mapping will be needed to identify a gene unambiguously.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="schema_description.html#peptide_archive">peptide_archive</a> contains old peptide sequences for peptides that changed. 
This was introduced together with versioning of the peptides so a stable id and version uniquely identify a peptide.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="schema_description.html#stable_id_event">stable_id_event</a> table keeps track of information flow from <strong>genes</strong>, <strong>transcripts</strong> and <strong>translations</strong>.
Newly introduced stable ids will have a <strong>NULL</strong> old stable id.
Similarly a deleted stable id will get a <strong>NULL</strong> new <strong>stable_id</strong>.
If the gene "splits" and parts map to genes with different <strong>stable_id</strong>s, an event is created describing this.
