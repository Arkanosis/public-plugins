<h1>Quantitative Trait Loci Tables</h1>

<p>
Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) are mappings of phenotypic traits to locations that are defined by markers. 
The <a href="schema_description.html#qtl">qtl</a> table contains the text description of the phenotype (eg high blood pressure) and a location defined by flanking markers and a "peak" marker.
This means the specified trait is likely to be influenced by the area between flanking markers and most likely by the peak marker position.
The likelihood of the association can be scored by lod_score.
The markers used in the <strong>qtl</strong> have to be stored in the marker part of the ensembl databases.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="schema_description.html#qtl_feature">qtl_feature</a> table specifies where the qtl and its associated markers are located in genomic coordinates.
</p>

<p>
Each QTL is usually named after the source that performed the experiments and stored in 
<a href="schema_description.html#qtl_synonym">qtl_synonyms</a>.
Currently only rats have qtls and so all possible <strong>source_databases</strong> are rat databases.
