<h1>General Feature Tables</h1>

<p>
Generally, feature tables consist of the following columns:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
A <strong>feature_id</strong>.
The column name should be <strong>tablename_id</strong>.
Not all features need to have a feature ID.
All features that have links in other tables need one; others might have one out of consistency reasons.
In the future they may become mandatory.
</li>

<li>
All features describe their sequence position with a link to the <a href="schema_description.html#seq_region">seq_region</a> they are defined on.
They have <strong>seq_start</strong> and <strong>seq_end</strong> on this region, which range from 1 to the length of the linked <strong>seq_region</strong>.
Most will have strand information.
The strand does not change the counting for the sequence position, which always happens from the 5-prime end of the <a href="schema_description.html#seq_region">seq_region</a>.
</li>

<li>
Many features will contain a displayable name (<strong>display_label</strong> or <strong>name</strong>).
Future changes might make this more consistent.
</li>

<li>
Almost all features link to an <a href="schema_description.html#analysis">analysis</a> entry.
</li>

<li>
Special features contain any number of other attributes; <strong>simple_feature</strong> entries for example contain a <strong>score</strong> entry.
</li>

</ol>
