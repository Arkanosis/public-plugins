<h1>Using the Ensembl datasets hosted on Amazon AWS</h1>

<p>
There are two ways of accessing Ensembl data from within <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> service.</p>

<h2>Public Data Sets MySQL flat-file and FASTA dumps</h2>

<p>From Amazon's website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS Hosted Public Data Sets provide a convenient way to share, access,
and use public domain or non-proprietary data within your Amazon EC2
environment. Select public data sets are hosted on AWS for free as an
Amazon EBS snapshot. Any Amazon EC2 customer can access this data by
creating their own personal Amazon EBS volume from a publicly shared
Amazon EBS public data set snapshot. They can then access, modify, and
perform computation on these data sets directly using an Amazon EC2
instance and just pay for the compute and storage resources that they
use.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Details of how to access the data can be found at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/">http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/</a>. The snapshot IDs you will need are:</p>

<ul>
<li>MySQL dumps - snap-8e62d6e5</li>
<li>FASTA dumps - snap-3062d65b</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mounting snapshots of raw MySQL data files</h2>

<p>We also provide snapshots of EBS volumes containing the raw .MYI and .MYD data files. These are publically available and can be mounted as EBS volumes for your own use. Note that you will be charged by Amazon at their standard rate for the use of EBS. You can then configure your MySQL instance to point to the files on the new volume (via the datadir parameter in the MySQL configuration file). The snapshot IDs for each Ensembl release are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>59 - snap-fc1d3c97</li>
<li>58 - snap-12183979</li>
<li>57 - snap-6016370b</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you will need to add a mysql/ directory/database containing the approporiate user accounts and grants.</p>
