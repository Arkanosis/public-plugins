<h1>Using the Ensembl dataset hosted on Amazon AWS</h1>

<p>
The MySQL data and index files for the current release of Ensembl can
be accessed from within <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon's
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> service. From the Amazon website:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
AWS Hosted Public Data Sets provide a convenient way to share, access,
and use public domain or non-proprietary data within your Amazon EC2
environment. Select public data sets are hosted on AWS for free as an
Amazon EBS snapshot. Any Amazon EC2 customer can access this data by
creating their own personal Amazon EBS volume from a publicly shared
Amazon EBS public data set snapshot. They can then access, modify, and
perform computation on these data sets directly using an Amazon EC2
instance and just pay for the compute and storage resources that they
use.

Details of how to access the data can be found
at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/">http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/</a>.
