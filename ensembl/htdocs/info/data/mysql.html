<h1>The Ensembl public MySQL Server</h1>

<p>For large amounts of data and more detailed analysis, we recommend you use our 
publicly-accessible MySQL server, <strong>ensembldb.ensembl.org</strong>,
which you can access as user 'anonymous'.</p>

<p>There are two options for retrieving data from this database:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Perl API</dt>
<dd>The easiest option is to use the Ensembl <a href="/info/data/api/">Perl API</a>. 
The API uses an object-oriented approach to model real biological objects such as genes, 
transcripts and 'slices' of DNA sequence, making it straightforward for you to write 
scripts that retrieve and analyze data.
<pre class="code">
# find gene stable ids corresponding to the MGI symbol 'Tyr'
my $gene_adaptor = $dbCore-&gt;get_GeneAdaptor();
my @genes = @{ $gene_adaptor-&gt;fetch_all_by_external_name('Tyr') };
</pre>
<p>Additional code examples and suggestions can be found in the various <a href="/info/data/api/">API tutorials</a> and the 
<a href="http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailing-lists-archives/ensembl-dev/threads.html" rel="external">ensembl-dev mailing list archives</a>.</dd>

<dt>MySQL client</dt>
<dd>Alternatively, you can use a MySQL <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads">client program</a> to query the database directly. However this does require knowledge of the
complex <a href="/info/data/api/">database schemas</a> used by Ensembl, so we only recommend 
it if you are unable to install our API (e.g. if you have no access to Perl). Also note that 
direct MySQL queries on the database are not suited to retrieve sequences. To retrieve sequences 
please use the Perl API.<br />
<strong>Important note:</strong> From release 48 you need a MySQL5-compatible client and 
to connect to port 5306; releases 47 and earlier are on MySQL4 and use the standard port (3306).</dd>
