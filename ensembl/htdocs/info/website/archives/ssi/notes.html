<h2 class="clear-left">Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ensembl aims to maintain stable identifiers for genes (ENSG), 
transcripts (ENST), proteins (ENSP) and exons (ENSE) as long as possible. 
Changes  within the genome sequence assembly or an updated genome 
annotation may dramatically change a gene model. In these cases, the old 
set of stable IDs is retired and a new one assigned. Gene and transcript
pages both have an ID History view which maps changes in the ID
from the earliest version in Ensembl.</li>

<li>Protein family identifiers (fam), Ensembl EST gene identifiers
(ENSESTG) and Genscan identifiers (GENSCAN) are currently not stable.</li>

<li>With the exception of the GRCh37 human site <strong>BLAST, BLAT and other tools</strong> are not available from the archive sites.</li>

<li><strong>Accounts</strong> are shared between the current site and almost all archives. The exceptions are the older human NCBI36 and the mouse GRCm37 sites where changes in architecture and code make sharing logins impractical.</li.
