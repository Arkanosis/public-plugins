<h2>About Archive Ensembl</h2>

<p><img src="/img/generic-archive-roundel.gif" alt="Archive_ensembl"
        class="float-left" style="width:120px;height=:120px" />The main Ensembl
      site (www.ensembl.org) and the mirror sites are updated with the latest data on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The Ensembl Archive sites have been set up so there is a stable link 
for three years to pages from a particular release (e.g. version 75 from 
February 2014) in Ensembl.</p>

<p>These links will be suitable for referring to Ensembl pages in publications.</p>

<p>A few older archives may be maintained if they include significant datasets for key species, 
but the availability of these sites cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>As from August 2014 we are supporting the <strong>human GRCh37
        assembly</strong> at our dedicated <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html" target="blank">GRCh37
        human</a> site. Unlike the usual Ensembl archive sites, this will be
      maintained and updated with new features with each release of
      Ensembl. Annotation on the <strong>human NCBI36 assembly</strong> is available at our <a
        href="http://may2009.archive.ensembl.org//Homo_sapiens/Info/Index"
        target="blank">Ensembl 54 archive</a> site.</p>

<p>For all enquiries, please <a href="/Help/Contact" class="popup">contact the Ensembl HelpDesk</a>. </p>
