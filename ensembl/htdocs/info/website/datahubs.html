<h1>Public datahubs</h1>

<p>Ensembl now provides support for datahubs (also known as track hubs),
which are an alternative to DAS for sharing large quantities of annotation
over the internet. We do not host these datahubs ourselves, but a list of
publicly accessible hubs is given below. Just click on a 
link to attach the hub to the appropriate species' 
Region in detail view.</p>

<p>Please note that tracks are not turned on by default, as there
can be thousands in a hub. Open the control panel by clicking on
the gearwheel icon, and select your hub from the lefthand menu.</p>
