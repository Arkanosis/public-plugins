<h1>Annotation of Ig/Tcr Segment Genes</h1>

<p>
Ensembl Ig Segment genes are annotations of the Immunoglobulin and
T-cell receptor segments present in germ-line genomic DNA. During
B-cell and T-cell maturation, these segments are rearranged and
brought together by V-D-J recombination to form functional
Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes.
</p>
<p>
The protein and nucleotide databases contain many sequences of
mature Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor genes. Inferring gene structures
by aligning these to the genome using the standard Ensembl <a href="genome_annotation.html">genebuild</a>
pipeline gives unsatisfactory results, for two main reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The non-coding DNA that separates pairs of gene segments brought together by V-D-J recombination 
is not an intron, and the segment boundaries display different sequence signals to splice sites. 
Spliced alignment programs such as 
<a rel="external" href="http://genome.cshlp.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/5/988?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&volume=14&firstpage=988&resourcetype=HWCIT">GeneWise</a>
therefore require retuning in order to predict the segment structure correctly.
</li>
<li>
Some segments comprise multiple exons. Delineating a "spliced"
alignment of a mature Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor sequence to the
genome into its constituent segments is therefore not straightforward.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For this reason, Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene segments have
been annotated differently to other Ensembl genes. Ensembl makes use of the 
<a rel="external" href="http://imgt.cines.fr">IMGT database</a>, which provides annotation of
individual gene segments on reference sequences. Ensembl extracts individual
segment sequences and aligns them to the genome using the
<a rel="external" href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/31">Exonerate</a> alignment tool.
</p>
<p>
To reflect their role in the V-D-J recombination process, segments are
annotated as belonging to one of four classes: V segment, D segment, J
segment and C segment.  At present, Ensembl Ig segment annotations are only available for
human and mouse.
