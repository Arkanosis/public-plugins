<h1>Annotation of Non-Coding RNAs</h1>

<h2>Non-coding RNA Overview</h2>

<p>
<strong>Non-coding RNAs</strong> (ncRNAs) are involved in many
biological processes and are increasingly seen as important. As is the
case with proteins, it is the overall structure of the molecule which
imparts function. However, while similar protein structures are often
reflected in a conserved amino acid sequence, sequences underlying RNA
secondary structure are very variable; this makes ncRNAs difficult to
detect using sequence alone.
</p>

<p>
Because of this, we use a variety of techniques to detect
ncRNAs. First, a combination of sensitive BLAST searches are used to
identify likely targets, then a covariance model search is used to
measure the probability that the targets can fold into the structures
required. Other ncRNAs are added as part of the raw compute stage.

<h2 id="Details">Annotation Details</h2>

<p>
Most <strong>ncRNAs</strong> are annotated by aligning genomic
sequence against <a rel="external"
href="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/">RFAM</a> using <a rel="external"
href="http://blast.wustl.edu/">BLASTN</a>. The BLAST hits are
clustered and filtered by E value and are used to seed Infernal
searches of the locus with the corresponding RFAM covariance
models. The purpose of this is to reduce the search space required, as
to scan the entire genome with all the RFAM covariance models would be
extremely CPU-intensive. The resulting BLAST hits are then used as
supporting evidence for ncRNA genes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>miRNAs</strong> are predicted by BLASTN of genomic sequence
slices against <a rel="external"
href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/">miRBase</a> sequences. All
species are used. The BLAST hits are clustered and filtered by E value
and the aligned genomic sequence is then checked for possible
secondary structure using RNAFold. If evidence is found that the
genomic sequence could form a stable hairpin structure, the locus is
used to create a miRNA gene model. The resulting BLAST hit is used as
supporting evidence for the miRNA gene.
</p>

<p>
Note: The miRNA identifier and name are only associated to the
resulting Ensembl miRNA if they are of the same species.

<strong>tRNAs</strong> are annotated as part of the raw compute
process using <a rel="external"
