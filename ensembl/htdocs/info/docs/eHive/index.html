<h1>eHive production system</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a distributed processing system based on 'autonomous agents' and
Hive behavioural structure of Honey Bees.  It implements all functionality of both
data-flow graphs and block-branch diagrams which should allow it to codify
any program, algorithm, or parallel processing job control system.  It is
not bound to any processing 'farm' system and can be adapted to any GRID.
It builds on the design of the Ensembl Pipeline/Analysis and presently uses
Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::RunnableDB perl wrapper objects as nodes/blocks in
the graphs but could be adapted more generally.
