<h1>Changing the appearance of your Ensembl website</h1>

<p>
Here at the Ensembl project, in addition to www.ensembl.org  we run many different 
websites based on Ensembl code, including public sites such as pre!, Vega and 
the Ensembl archives, and private sites used for internal development.
In order to distinguish these sites we use plugins to alter the colour scheme
and/or site logo, in addition to the changes in content. For example, the Vega site 
is blue, pre! is turquoise, and the archives are lilac.
</p>

<p>
You may find it useful to do something similar with an Ensembl mirror,
so that your users know they are looking at a local copy and not the actual
Ensembl site.
</p>

<p>In the examples below, we'll assume that you are adding these changes
to the normal <code>/public-plugins/mirror</code> directory.</p>

<p><strong>Important note</strong>: if you make any changes to .ini files,
you need to remove <code>/conf/config.packed</code> before restarting the
server, to ensure your changes are recompiled.</p> 

<h2>Changing the site logo</h2>

<p>The Ensembl logo graphic can be found in <code>/htdocs/img/</code> directory.
First you should make a directory</p>

<p><code>/public-plugins/mirror/htdocs/img/</code></p>

<p>and copy your logo into it. Ideally your logo should be around 
40 pixels high, so that it does not break the template layout.</p> 

<p>You will then need to add the following lines to 
your <code>/public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/DEFAULTS.ini</code> file,
substituting the appropriate parameters:</p>

<pre class="code">
[ENSEMBL_STYLE]
SITE_LOGO               = /img/mylogo.gif
SITE_LOGO_WIDTH         = 100
SITE_LOGO_HEIGHT        = 40
SITE_LOGO_ALT           = Ensembl mirror
SITE_LOGO_HREF          = /ensembl/             ; Optional (see note below) 
</pre>

<p>The <code>SITE_LOGO_HREF</code> parameter is only needed if your Ensembl mirror does not occupy the root
of the host domain - omit this line to use the default link "/"</p>

<h2>Changing the colour scheme</h2>

<p>The colour scheme can be altered by adding the following to
<code>/public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/DEFAULTS.ini</code>
(you can omit the [ENSEMBL_STYLE] header if you already have
a custom logo defined, as above):

<pre class="code">
[ENSEMBL_STYLE]

BACKGROUND1  = 333333 ; Edge colour for navigation menu / darkest background
BACKGROUND2  = 666666 ;
BACKGROUND3  = 999999 ; background colour used for LH navigation bar
BACKGROUND4  = cccccc ; Light colour background used for dynamic images
BACKGROUND5  = eeeeee ; Lightest colour background used for dynamic images

DEFAULT_ICON = /img/bullet.gif ; image used for LH buttons.

HEADING      = 999999 ; colour used for headings / buttons
SPECIESNAME  = 666666 ; colour used for scriptname heading

LINK         = 0000cc ;
LINK_VISIT   = 993399 ;
LINK_HOVER   = cc0000 ; colour used for active / hover links;

RELEASE_BG   = 999999 ; This is the colour of the release bar
RELEASE_EDGE = 333333 ; This is the colour of the edge of the release bar

CONTIGBLUE1  = 368ec9 ; Contig-colours (light)
CONTIGBLUE2  = 02599c ; Contig-colours (dark)

HIGHLIGHT1   = ffff99 ; Highlight colour (pale)
HIGHLIGHT2   = ffff66 ; Highlight colour (vivid)
</pre>

<p>Simple alter the hex values to the colours you want. These placeholder 
values will be compiled into the Ensembl css files on server startup.</p>

<p>Note: changing the bullet graphic is optional, but you may find that
the default bullet does not look good on a different background colour!</p>
