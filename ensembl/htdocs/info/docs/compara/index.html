<h1>Comparative Genomics</h1>

<h2>Data available</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gene trees</strong> are constructed using the longest protein for every gene in Ensembl: proteins are clustered using hcluster_sg based on wublastp scores, and each cluster of proteins is aligned using MCoffee. Finally, TreeBeST is used to produce a gene tree from each multiple alignment, reconciling it with the species tree to call duplication events. <strong>Homologues</strong> are deduced from these trees.
<a href="homology_method.html">More information</a></li> 

<li><strong>Families</strong> are constructed by MCL clustering of all Ensembl proteins, i.e. not only the longest protein.  
Metazoan proteins from <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/">UniProtKB SwissProt and TrEMBL</a> 
are added to extend the protein set. <a href="family.html">More information &rarr;</a></li>

<li><strong>Whole genome alignments</strong> are performed either pairwise between two species using BlastZ-net or translated Blat analysis, or using multiple species. <a href="analyses.html">More information &rarr;</a></li>

<li><strong>Ancestral sequences</strong> are calculated from multi-species whole genome 
alignments.  <a href="analyses.html#ancestral">More information&rarr;</a></li>

<li><strong> Conservation scores and constrained elements </strong> are 
calculated from the whole genome multiple alignments.  
<a href="analyses.html#conservation">More information&rarr;</a></li>

<li><strong> Syntenies </strong> are calculated from the pairwise alignments.

</ul>

<h2>Access</h2>
<p>
<strong>Data</strong> can be accessed using the <a href="/info/docs/api/compara/index.html">Compara Perl API</a>, 
<a href="/info/data/biomart.html">BioMart</a>, or comparative genomics pages on the browser.
Gene trees can be viewed from any 'Gene' page on the browser, and exported via the control panel and the Jalview plug-in
in the pop-ups that appear when clicking on any part of the tree.
