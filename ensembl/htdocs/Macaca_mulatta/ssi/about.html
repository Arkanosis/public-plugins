Mmul_0.1 is a preliminary assembly of the rhesus monkey, <i>Macaca
mulatta</i> using whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads from small and medium
insert clones.
</p>

<p>
The release was produced by assembling whole genome shotgun
reads with the Atlas genome assembly system at the <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/">Baylor College of
Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center</a>. Several WGS libraries, with
inserts of 2-4 kb and 10 kb were used to produce the data.
 Highly repeated sequences and sequences from BAC clones were
omitted.</p>

<p>This is a draft
sequence and may contain errors so users should exercise
caution. Typical errors in draft genome sequences include
misassemblies of repeated sequences, collapses of repeated regions,
and unmerged overlaps (e.g. due to polymorphisms) creating artificial
duplications. However base accuracy in contigs (contiguous blocks of
sequence) is usually very high with most errors near the ends of
contigs. [<a href ="ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/data/Rmacaque/fasta/README_Mmul.txt">More about the assembly</a>].
