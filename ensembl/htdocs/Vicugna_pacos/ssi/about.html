This is the first release of the low-coverage 2.51X assembly of the  
alpaca (vicugna pacos). The genome sequencing is provided by
the <a href=" http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/">Human Genome Sequencing Center</a>, 
Baylor College of Medicine and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.</p>
</p>

<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies  
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs  
is 178.39 kb and is 3.91 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in  
supercontigs is 2.93 Gb and in contigs is 1.92 Gb.

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was 
necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" super-structures, 
in order to present complete genes. There are 3711 such gene-scaffolds, 
with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".

<h4>Mammalian Genome Project</h4>
<p><i>Vicugna pacos</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the
Mammalian Genome Project, funded by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH). A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch length of
the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian
species. Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals
and used in alignments for cross-species comparison. The aim is to
increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the
human genome.
