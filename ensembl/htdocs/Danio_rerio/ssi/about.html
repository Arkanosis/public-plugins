<h2 class="first">About the Zebrafish genome</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio">zebrafish
genome project</a> is a collaboration between the Sanger Institute and
the zebrafish community, announced during the <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Info/Press/001121.shtml">Sanger Institute
Zebrafish Workshop 2000</a> and was started in February 2001.</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>

assembly version 7 (Zv7), as released on 13 July 2007. This assembly was 
produced by integrating finished clone sequence from the physical map 
with whole genome shotgun assembly sequence (<a

information</a>).</p>

<p>The zebrafish sequencing project is funded by the <a

<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p> This site provides a full Ensembl gene set for Zv7. This release
is based on a strategy where transcripts are generated based on
protein evidence and clustered in genes. Aligned zebrafish cDNAs are
used to add UTR regions. Genes are named based on the alignment of
their coding regions to known entries in public databases;
ZFIN genes have priority in this process.</p>
