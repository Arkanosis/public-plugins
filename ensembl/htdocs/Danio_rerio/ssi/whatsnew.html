<h3 class="boxed">What's New in Ensembl 33</h3>
<ul class="spaced">
<li><strong>Affy mapping</strong><br />Some AffyMetrix data was accidentally omitted from the last release of Ensembl (v32, July 2005). These data have been re-computed and added to the core databases of the affected species.</li>
<li><strong>Fixes to affy_feature</strong><br />The affy_feature table in the core database had no values in the 'mismatches' column in the last release; the correct values have been added.</li>
<li><strong>Updates to gene table</strong><br />The Zebrafish core and est databases had incorrect values for biotype and confidence in the gene table, resulting in EST genes being displayed in the wrong colour and without exons. This has been corrected in release 33.</li>
<li><strong>Compara</strong><br />Addition of paralogues for mouse, drosophila and zebrafish.</li>
<li><strong>HUGO name changes</strong><br />The display name for the HUGO database has been changed to 'HGNC symbol' in order to match current usage by SwissProt, etc.</li>
