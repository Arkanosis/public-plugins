        <h2>What's New in Ensembl <i>Danio rerio</i></h2>

<h3 class="boxed" id="cat2">Data updates</h3>

<h4 id="item27">Affy mapping</h4>
<p>Some AffyMetrix data was accidentally omitted from the last release of Ensembl (v32, July 2005). These data have been re-computed and added to the core databases of the affected species.</p>

<h4 id="item30">Fixes to affy_feature</h4>
<p>The affy_feature table in the core database had no values in the 'mismatches' column in the last release; the correct values have been added.</p>

<h4 id="item31">Updates to gene table</h4>
<p>The Zebrafish core and est databases had incorrect values for biotype and confidence in the gene table, resulting in EST genes being displayed in the wrong colour and without exons. This has been corrected in release 33.</p>

<h4 id="item42">Compara</h4>
<p>Addition of paralogues for mouse, drosophila and zebrafish.</p>

<h4 id="item40">HUGO name changes</h4>
<p>The display name for the HUGO database has been changed to 'HGNC symbol' in order to match current usage by SwissProt, etc.</p>

<h4 id="item41">New variation databases</h4>
<p>All species have new variation databases.</p>

<h3 class="boxed" id="cat4">Web features</h3>

<h4 id="item45">Bug fixes</h4>
<p>A number of small bugs in the new-style view pages have been fixed, including missing popup menus in SyntenyView.</p>

<h3 class="boxed" id="cat1">API/web code changes</h3>

<h4 id="item44">Perl method status</h4>
<p>The Perldoc for the Perl API has been expanded to indicate the status of each method: 'stable', 'at risk', or 'medium risk'.</p>

<h3 class="boxed" id="cat3">Schema changes</h3>

<h4 id="item43">New column in external_db</h4>
<p>A new column, db_display_name, has been added to external_db, to replace the hardcoded web code hashmap previously used, and the API updated to support the change.</p>
