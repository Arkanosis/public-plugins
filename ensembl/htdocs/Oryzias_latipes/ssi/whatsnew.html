<li><strong>SSAHA</strong><br />From release 50 we will no longer be providing SSAHA sequence search. If you wish to run your own SSAHA sequence search you can download the files to generate the search hashes from our FTP site.</li>
<li><strong>Projections of gene names and GO terms</strong><br />These have been done as usual, between a variety of species.</li>
<li><strong>Stored peptide stats</strong><br />In order to improve efficiency on ProtView, peptide statistics are now calculated in advance and stored as translation attributes, instead of being calculated on the fly.</li>
