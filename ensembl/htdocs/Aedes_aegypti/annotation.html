<h3><i>Aedes agypti</i> Annotation</h3>
<p>
The VectorBase Aedes data release consists of 17,776 gene
predictions. These genes were predicted using the Ensembl annotation
pipeline and represent models  generated by GeneWise (E. Birney) from
protein similarities and by Exonerate (G. Slater) from Aedes
transcript similarities (EST and cDNA). Some filtering to remove
potential transposon sequences has been implemented. Currently,
12,250 of the predictions map to EST alignments.

<p>
The TIGR Aedes data release includes a set of 28,301 consensus gene
predictions.  These genes were modeled based on a combination of
Augustus (M. Stanke), GlimmerHMM (M. Pertea), Genie (D. Kulp), and
Twinscan (M. Brent) gene predictions, coupled with protein and EST
genome alignments.  The consensus gene models included in this
release encode proteins with matches to other known proteins, signal
peptides, transmembrane domains, or matches to Pfam or TIGRfam
domains. 12,277 genes mapped to EST alignments, providing evidence of
expression. 18,006 have a Blast match to an Anopheles gambiae protein
and 13,744 have a Blast match to a Drosophila melanogaster protein
(E=1e-10).  Please note that the genes in this TIGR release do not
have permanent accessions. This gene set is considered preliminary,
and the genes may or may not be in the final release.
