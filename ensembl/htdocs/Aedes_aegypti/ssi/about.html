Ensembl data and displays for <i>Aedes&nbsp;aegypti</i> are
made possible through a joint effort by the Ensembl group and
VectorBase, a <a href="http://www.brc-central.org/cgi-bin/brc-central/brc_central.cgi">NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Center</a>.  Please access

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p>
<img src="/img/species/pic_Aedes_aegypti.png" height="96" width="141" class="float-left" alt="A.aegypti" title="pull it out!" />
<i>Aedes aegypti</i> is the primary mosquito vector responsible for the  
transmission of both the yellow fever and dengue fever viruses.
</p>

<p>The <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Liverpool LVP strain genome sequence is a joint  
effort between the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a> and 
<a href="http://www.tigr.org/">The Institute for Genomic  
Research</a> (TIGR). Assembly of 8x shotgun coverage was performed using  
the Broad's whole genome assembly package ARACHNE.
The assembly presented here (AaegL1, August 2005) consists of 4,758 supercontigs,  
totalling 1.3 Gigabases, with a Contig N50 of 82 Kb and supercontig N50 size of 1,500 Kb.
</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>
The annotation of the Aedes genome is a collaboration between  
VectorBase and TIGR. Each group generated a set of gene predictions  
which were merged into a single canonical set (AaegL1.1). See the  
<a href="/Aedes_aegypti/annotation.html">brief overview</a> for details
of how each set was generated. The merging strategy will be described 
in the genome paper (in preparation).
