<p>This is the second Ensembl release of the low-coverage 1.93X assembly of 
the American pika (Ochotona princeps). The genome sequencing and 
assembly is provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in 
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is 
53.58 kb and is 3.27 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in 
supercontigs is 3.43 Gb and in contigs is 1.92 Gb.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>A standard Ensembl projection build was carried out whereby genes from 
the new human gene set (from release 48) were projected onto the pika 
assembly. Owing to the fragmentary nature of the preliminary pika 
assembly, it was necessary to arrange some scaffolds into 
"gene-scaffold" super-structures in order to present complete genes. 
There are 5537 such gene scaffolds, with identifiers of the form 
"GeneScaffold_1".</p>
