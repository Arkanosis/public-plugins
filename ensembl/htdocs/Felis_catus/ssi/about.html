<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Felis_catus.png" height="101" width="120" class="float-left" alt="Cat" title="Mee-OW!" />
This is the second release of the low-coverage 1.87X assembly of the
domestic cat (Felis catus). The genome sequencing was performed by
<a href="http://www.agencourt.com/">Agencourt Bioscience</a> and assembly 
provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs
is 45.22 kb and is 2.38 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in
supercontigs is 3.94 Gb and in contigs is 1.64 Gb.

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>A standard Ensembl projection build was carried out whereby genes from
the new human gene set (from release 49) were projected onto the cat
assembly.</p>

<p>Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly,
it was necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold"
super-structures, in order to present complete genes. There are 5280
such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".</p>
