The platypus (<i>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</i>) genome of a female nicknamed
"Glennie" (collected at the Upper Barnard River on Glen Rock Station,
New South Wales) was sequenced to a total of 6x whole genome
coverage. The sequencing strategy we utilized, combined whole genome
shotgun plasmid, fosmid and BAC end sequences. The combined sequence
reads were assembled using the PCAP software (Genome
Res. 13(9):2164-70 2003). This draft sequence assembly submitted to
Genbank is referred to as Ornithorhynchus_anatinus-5.0. Future
improvements to the platypus draft sequence assembly will be dependent
on the availability of funding and improvements to existing assembler
software. Funding for the sequencing of the platypus genome
was provided by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),
National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>
