The platypus (<i>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</i>) genome of a female nicknamed
"Glennie" (collected at the Upper Barnard River on Glen Rock Station,
New South Wales) was sequenced to a total of 6x whole genome
coverage. The sequencing strategy we utilized, combined whole genome
shotgun plasmid, fosmid and BAC end sequences. The combined sequence
reads were assembled using the PCAP software (Genome
Res. 13(9):2164-70 2003). This draft sequence assembly submitted to
Genbank is referred to as Ornithorhynchus_anatinus-5.0. Future
improvements to the platypus draft sequence assembly will be dependent
on the availability of funding and improvements to existing assembler
software. Funding for the sequencing of the platypus genome
was provided by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),
National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>The gene set for Platypus was built using a modified version of the 
standard Ensembl genebuild pipeline. The species-specific sequence resources 
(platypus cDNA and protein) are very limited, so the vast majority of gene 
models are based on genewise alignments of proteins from other species. 
Most of the proteins being aligned were from species genetically distant to 
platypus. To improve the accuracy of models generated from these proteins, the 
genewise alignments were made to stretches of genomic sequence rather
than to 'miniseqs'. Platypus and human cDNAs were aligned and used to 
add UTRs to the genewise predictions where possible. The gene models were 
assessed by generating sets of potential orthologs to genes from other 
mammalian species and chicken. Potentially missing predictions and partial 
gene predictions were identified by examining the orthologs, and exonerate 
was used to build new gene models for these based on the human and chicken 
ortholog peptide sequence.</p>
