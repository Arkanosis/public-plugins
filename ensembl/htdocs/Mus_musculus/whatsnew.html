        <h2>What's New in Ensembl <i>Mus musculus</i></h2>

<h3 class="boxed" id="cat2">Data updates</h3>

<h4 id="item38">Mouse BAC Clones</h4>
<p>Entries have been added to the assembly so that BAC clones can be fetched.</p>

<h4 id="item27">Affy mapping</h4>
<p>Some AffyMetrix data was accidentally omitted from the last release of Ensembl (v32, July 2005). These data have been re-computed and added to the core databases of the affected species.</p>

<h4 id="item30">Fixes to affy_feature</h4>
<p>The affy_feature table in the core database had no values in the 'mismatches' column in the last release; the correct values have been added.</p>

<h4 id="item39">Transcript supporting evidence</h4>
<p>The supporting evidence table IDs have been adjusted so that all transcripts show the correct evidence.</p>

<h4 id="item40">HUGO name changes</h4>
<p>The display name for the HUGO database has been changed to 'HGNC symbol' in order to match current usage by SwissProt, etc.</p>

<h4 id="item41">New variation databases</h4>
<p>All species have new variation databases.</p>

<h3 class="boxed" id="cat4">Web features</h3>

<h4 id="item45">Bug fixes</h4>
<p>A number of small bugs in the new-style view pages have been fixed, including missing popup menus in SyntenyView.</p>

<h3 class="boxed" id="cat1">API/web code changes</h3>

<h4 id="item44">Perl method status</h4>
<p>The Perldoc for the Perl API has been expanded to indicate the status of each method: 'stable', 'at risk', or 'medium risk'.</p>

<h3 class="boxed" id="cat3">Schema changes</h3>

<h4 id="item43">New column in external_db</h4>
<p>A new column, db_display_name, has been added to external_db, to replace the hardcoded web code hashmap previously used, and the API updated to support the change.</p>
