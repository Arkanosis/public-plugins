<h3 class="boxed">What's New in Ensembl 32</h3>
<ul class="spaced">
<li><strong>Mouse BAC Clones</strong><br />Entries have been added to the assembly so that BAC clones can be fetched.</li>
<li><strong>Affy mapping</strong><br />Some AffyMetrix data was accidentally omitted from the last release of Ensembl (v32, July 2005). These data have been re-computed and added to the core databases of the affected species.</li>
<li><strong>Fixes to affy_feature</strong><br />The affy_feature table in the core database had no values in the 'mismatches' column in the last release; the correct values have been added.</li>
<li><strong>Transcript supporting evidence</strong><br />The supporting evidence table IDs have been adjusted so that all transcripts show the correct evidence.</li>
<li><strong>HUGO name changes</strong><br />The display name for the HUGO database has been changed to 'HGNC symbol' in order to match current usage by SwissProt, etc.</li>
