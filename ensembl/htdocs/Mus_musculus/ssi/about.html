<h3 class="boxed">About the Mouse genome</h3>

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p>Ensembl Mouse is based on the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/NCBIContigInfo.html">
NCBI m35 mouse assembly</a> (December 2005, strain C57BL/6J).
</p>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Mus_musculus.png" height="80" width="130" class="float-right" alt="Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium" title="squeak squeak!" />The Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium is a joint project between 
<a href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/">The Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research</a>, 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Washington University Genome Sequencing Center</a>, 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> 
and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL - EBI</a> to provide the Mouse genome sequence to the world. 
We work closely with other Mouse groups to provide an integrated resource (see below for credits).</p>
      
<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>This site provides a full Ensembl gene build for the above assembly. 
There are some major changes in the assembly; for more details see 
the <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/contig/Build35.html" 
rel="external">NCBI build statistics </a>. </p>

<p>Modifications to the systems have further improved the gene set. 95% of 
the known genes and 68% of the novel genes from build m34 retain the 
same Ensembl gene ids in this release. There will also be a new build on 
m36 soon.</p>
