<h3 class="boxed">About the Mouse genome</h3>

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p>Ensembl Mouse is based on the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.cgi?taxid=10090">
NCBI m37 mouse assembly</a> (April 2007, strain C57BL/6J).
</p>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Mus_musculus.png" height="80" width="130" class="float-right" alt="Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium" title="squeak squeak!" />The Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium is a joint project between 
<a href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/">The Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research</a>, 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Washington University Genome Sequencing Center</a>, 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> 
and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL - EBI</a> to provide the Mouse genome sequence to the world. 
We work closely with other Mouse groups to provide an integrated resource (see below for credits).</p>
      
<p>There are some major changes in the assembly from version m36; for more details see 
the <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/stats/BuildStats.cgi?taxid=10090&build=37&ver=1" 
rel="external">NCBI build statistics </a>. </p>

<div class="notice">For the convenience of our users, we have created a web-based 'wizard' which enables you to <a href="/Mus_musculus/assemblyconverter">convert a GFF file</a> from Mouse assembly m36 to m37.</div>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>For release 47 the gene annotation presented has been a combined 
Ensembl-Havana geneset, which incorporates more than 15,000 full-length 
protein-coding transcripts annotated by the Havana team in addition to the Ensembl 
automatic gene build. The mouse genome sequence is now considered 
sufficiently stable that since September 2006 the major genome browsers 
have come together to produce a common set of identifiers where CDS 
annotations of transcripts can be agreed and these identifiers are also 
shown.</p>

    href="/ccds.html">CCDS project</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modifications to the systems have further improved the gene set. 95% of 
the known genes and 47% of the novel genes from build m36 retain the 
same Ensembl gene ids in this release.</p>
