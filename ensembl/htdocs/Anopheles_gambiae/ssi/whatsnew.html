<h3 class="boxed">What's New in Ensembl 50</h3>
<h4><i>Anopheles gambiae</i> News</h4><p>There is no <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>-specific news this release.</p>

<h4>General News</h4><ul class="spaced">
<li><strong>Canonical Transcripts</strong><br /><p>Canonical transcripts have been defined for all genes in the core databases.<br /><a href="/Multi/newsview?rel=50#item952">Read more</a>...
</li>
<li><strong>SSAHA</strong><br />From release 50 we will no longer be providing SSAHA sequence search. If you wish to run your own SSAHA sequence search you can download the files to generate the search hashes from our FTP site.</li>
<li><strong>Projections of gene names and GO terms</strong><br />These have been done as usual, between a variety of species.</li>
<li><strong>Stored peptide stats</strong><br />In order to improve efficiency on ProtView, peptide statistics are now calculated in advance and stored as translation attributes, instead of being calculated on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Translation attributes for initial met and stop</strong><br />A script has been created and run which assigns translation attributes (value 1/0) depending on whether the translation has an initial methionine, and another depending on whether the transcript has a stop codon.</li>
