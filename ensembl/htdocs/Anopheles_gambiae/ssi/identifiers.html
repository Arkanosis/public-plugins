<h3>New Identifiers</h3>

<p>From genebuild 4, VectorBase stable identifiers for genes,  
transcripts and proteins are used instead of Ensembl-style  
identifiers.  All VB identifiers for Anopheles gambiae begin with the  
4 letters AGAP.  The same numeric value is used for a gene and all  
its products.  Alternative products of a single gene have suffixes  
ending A, B, C etc.</p>

<p>Ensembl-style identifiers in the previous genebuild have been mapped  
where possible to the new identifiers.  The web browser page  
IDHistoryView summarises relationships between old and new  
identifiers.  This page can be reached by clicking the 'ID history'  
link at the left of each gene view page or from the search results  
for an unmapped old-style identifier. You can also use
<a href="/Anopheles_gambiae/historyview">HistoryView</a> to enter 
a list of old-style identifiers and return a list of current
equivalents.</p>

<p>Example:  Gene CPR34 has the VB identifier AGAP006864, with  
transcript AGAP006864-RA and protein AGAP006864-PA.  The  
corresponding old identifiers were gene ENSANGG00000020866,  
transcript ENSANGT00000023320 and protein ENSANGP00000024283.</p>
