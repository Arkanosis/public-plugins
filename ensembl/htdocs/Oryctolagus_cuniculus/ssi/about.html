This is the first release of the low-coverage 2X assembly of rabbit 
(<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>).
The genome sequencing and assembly are provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in 
blocks of the N50 size or longer.
The N50 length for supercontigs is 54 kb and is 3.2 kb for contigs. The 
total number of bases in supercontigs is
3.45 Gb and in contigs is 2.08 Gb.</p>

<h4>Mammalian Genome Project</h4>
<p><i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i> is one of 16 mammals that will be sequenced as 
part of the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Mammalian Genome Project</a>, funded by the National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>).  
The species were chosen to 
maximise the branch length of the evolutionary
tree while representing the diversity of mammalian species.
Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals and used 
in alignments for cross-species comparison.
The aim is to increase our understanding of functional elements, 
especially in the human genome.
