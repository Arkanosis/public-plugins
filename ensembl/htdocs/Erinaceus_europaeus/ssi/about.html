<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Erinaceus_europaeus.png" height="90" width="110" class="float-left" alt="Hedgehog" title="rustle rustle" />
This is the first release of the low-coverage 1.86X assembly of the
western European hedgehog (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>). The genome sequencing
and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>

<p>The total number of bases in scaffolds is 3.37 Gb and in contigs it is 2.13 Gb.
</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" super-structures, in order to present complete genes. There are 9036 such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".

<h4>Mammalian Genome Project</h4>
<p><i>Erinaceus europaeus</i> is one of 16 mammals that will be sequenced as part
of the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Mammalian Genome Project</a>, funded by the National Institutes of
Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>). A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch
length of the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of
mammalian species. Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for
these mammals and used in alignments for cross-species comparison. The
aim is to increase our understanding of functional elements, especially
in the human genome.
