This is the first release of the low-coverage 2X assembly of the nine-banded armadillo (<em>Dasypus novemcinctus</em>). The genome sequencing and assembly are provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in 
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is 46 
kb and is 2.7 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in supercontigs 
is 3.85 Gb and in contigs is 2.15 Gb.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was
necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold"
super-structures, in order to present complete genes. There
are 8116 such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form
"GeneScaffold_1".</p>

<h4>Mammalian Genome Project</h4>
<p>
<i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i> is one of 16 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Mammalian Genome Project</a>, funded by the National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>).
The species were chosen to maximise the branch length of the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian species.</p>
                                                                                
<p>Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals and used in alignments for cross-species comparison.  The aim is to increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the human genome. <i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i> is of particular interest to developmental biologists owing to its habit of producing litters of four genetically-identical young, and it is also the animal model for leprosy.</p>
