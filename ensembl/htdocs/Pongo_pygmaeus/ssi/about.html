<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Pongo_pygmaeus.png" height="100" width="108" class="float-left" alt="Orangutan" title="Ook!" />
This site presents the whole genome shotgun assembly from a female Sumatran 
orangutan named Susie, housed at the Gladys Porter Zoo (Brownsville, TX). 
The primary donor-derived reads were assembled using PCAP (Huang, 2006) 
using stringent parameters; by aligning the orangutan genome against the 
human genome, it was possible to identify interchromosomal cross-overs and
thus eliminate global mis-assemblies larger than 50kb. 
</p>
<p>
Of the 3.09Gb of total sequence, 3.08Gb are ordered and oriented along
the chromosomes. Gap sizes between supercontigs were estimated based on
their size in human, with a maximum allowed gap size of 30kb.
</p>

<h4>Preliminary data</h4>
<p>
The pre site has orangutan-specific protein and cDNA aligned to the
genome along with the raw computes. We expect the full gene build 
to be ready in the spring of 2008.
