<li><strong>Human core updates</strong><br />Ensembl Human includes a new gene set, using ditags to build the UTRs. It also contains an improved merge between Ensembl-predicted genes and the latest Havana manually-annotated gene set. More genes have been removed from the Alpheus set.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory build</strong><br />The regulatory build on human has been updated, in line with the new genebuild.</li>
<li><strong>New variation databases</strong><br />Ensembl 50 includes a new orangutan variation database, with SNPs called by Ensembl using ssaha2/pileup from reference assembly reads, plus remapping of SNPs to the new assemblies for tetraodon and cow.<br /><a href="/Homo_sapiens/newsview?rel=50#item941">Read more</a>...
