<p>The Tetraodon genome project is a collaboration between <a href="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr">Genoscope</a> 
and the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu"> Broad Institute</a> (MIT). This Ensembl website presents 
sequence data and analyses provided by the two institutes  and annotation produced
using our Genebuild system..</p>

<p>The project was supported by the Consortium National de Recherche en 
Genomique and the National Human Genome Research Institute.</p>

<p>The genome assembly was performed using  <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/wga">Arachne</a> 
(Jaffe D.B. et. al. 2003. Gen. Res. 13, 91-96). This site presents version 8 of the assembly.</p>
         
<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>The majority of genes were annotated using a modified version of the standard Ensembl 
pipeline. This involved aligning protein, cDNA and EST sequences using exonerate and 
genewise to build gene models with UTRs and also using comparative analyses to 
find structures that the inital analysis missed. <!-- Genes annotated by 
<a href="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr">Genoscope</a> using GAZE were added to the set 
where we were unable to predict models. --></p>

<p>The annotation also includes 87 manually curated structures of a number of 
HOX and Cytokine genes.</p>
