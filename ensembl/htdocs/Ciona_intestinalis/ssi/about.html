<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Ciona_intestinalis.png" height="131" width="100" class="float-left" alt="Ciona intestinalis" title="Ciona intestinalis" />
<i>Ciona intestinalis</i> version 2.0 [<a href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Cioin2/Cioin2.info.html">details</a>] is a whole genome shotgun assembly released by the JGI. 
The <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> genome is the smallest of any experimentally manipulable chordate, and thus provides a good system for exploring vertebrate evolutionary origins. This Ensembl website presents the sequence data provided by the JGI, with additional Ensembl genebuild (see below).</p>
         
<p>The assembly release version 2.0 of the whole genome shotgun reads was constructed with the JAZZ assembly, using paired end sequencing reads. Starting with a coverage of 11x, additional data--including BAC and FISH markers--were used to map scaffolds to chromosome arms. The current size of the assembly which includes unmapped scaffolds is 173Mb with 94Mb of the assembly mapped to chromosome arms.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>The standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline was modified for annotation of the <i>Ciona</i> genome, owing to the lack of genomic information from closely-related species. Thus, in addition to aligning known <i>Ciona</i> proteins to the sequence (as per the standard pipeline), we aligned the large quantities of Ciona-specific cDNA and EST sequences against the genome, and then used protein data from other species to build additional gene models.</p>
