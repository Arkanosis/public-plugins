<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Gasterosteus_aculeatus.png" height="100" width="100" class="float-left" alt="Stickleback" title="ouch! ouch! ouch!" />
This is the first release of the Stickleback genome (<i>Gasterosteus 
aculeatus</i>). The genome sequencing and assembly are provided by the  
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Broad Institute</a>.
The assembly, has a base coverage of approximately 5.93X, constructed from 1935 
supercontigs, having N50 length of 10699.73Kb The total contig length is 0.45Gb 
spanning 0.46Gb bases (including gaps).

</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>
The annotation consists of aligned Stickleback proteins, cDNAs and ESTs. As well 
as alignments to Uniprot Unigene and EMBL vertebrate mRNAs.
</p>

<h4>Full gene build</h4>
<p>The release date for a full Ensembl gene build on this assembly is estimated for later this year. </p>
