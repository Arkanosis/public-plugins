<h4>Assembly</h4>

The EquCab2 assembly is a Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) assembly at 6.79x. A female thoroughbred named "Twilight" 
was selected as the representative horse for genome sequencing. The project coordination and genome sequencing 
and assembly is provided by the <a href=http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals>Broad Institute</a>.</p>
<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the contigs is 112.38 kb, and the total length of all contigs is 2.43 Gb. When the gaps between contigs in scaffolds are included, the total span of the assembly is 2.68 Gb.

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>
The horse EquCab2 was annotated using a standard Ensembl mammalian 
pipeline. Predictions from vertebrate mammals as well as horse
proteins have been given priority over predictions from non-vertebrate 
mammals. The set of predictions was been compared to 1:1 homologues
genes in human and mouse, and missing homologs in the horse annotation 
have been recovered using exonerate. Horse and human cDNAs have been 
used to add UTRs to protein based predictions. The final gene-set 
comprises 20,737 protein-coding genes, 2,863 identified as pseudogenes 
and 1,580 classified as retro-transposed genes.
