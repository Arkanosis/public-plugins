<h4>Assembly</h4>

The Equus1 assembly is a Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) assembly at 7x. A female thoroughbred named "Twilight" was selected as the representative horse for genome sequencing.  The project coordination and genome sequencing and assembly is provided by the <a href=http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals>Broad Institute</a>.</p>
<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the contigs is 116.04 kb and the N50 of the scaffolds is 29049.37 kb. The total length of all contigs is 2.42 Gb. When the gaps between contigs in scaffolds are included, the total span of the assembly is 2.68 Gb.</p>

<h4>Preliminary data</h4>
<p>
The preliminary set of gene predictions for the Equus assembly consists of genes built from 3 different evidence sources: Equus caballus specific proteins (1101 genes models), Ensembl predicted proteins in human with a homologue in mouse (14,912 gene models) and Ensembl-predicted proteins in mouse with a homologue in human (14,884 gene models). Also included are alignments of Equus caballus cDNAs and ESTs and of human and mouse cDNAs.
