<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Fugu_rubripes.png" height="65" width="100" alt="pufferfish" class="float-left" title="Bloop bloop" />This site presents version 4 of the Fugu genome, released in June 2005 by the <a href="http://www.fugu-sg.org/project/info.html">International Fugu Genome Consortium</a>. <i>Takifugu rubripes</i> has a very compact genome, with less than 15% consisting of dispersed repetitive sequence, which makes it ideal for gene discovery.</p>

<p>The latest assembly includes 7,213 scaffolds, constituting 390 Mb of the genome. 90% of the genome is on 1118 scaffolds. 74 scaffolds are larger than 1 Mb each and the largest scaffold is 7 Mb.  Please refer to the <a href="http://www.fugu-sg.org">Fugu Project's Webpage</a> for more details of the sequencing effort.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>Annotaion of this genome is also carried out by the Fugu Genome Project. A total of 22,008 gene loci have been predicted in this assembly.</p>
