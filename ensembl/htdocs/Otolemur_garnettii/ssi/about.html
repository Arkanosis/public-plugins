<p>
This is the first release of the low-coverage 1.5X assembly of the
bushbaby (<i>Otolemur garnettii</i>). The genome sequencing and assembly is
provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in 
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is 
101.35 kb and is 3.13 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in 
supercontigs is 3.39 Gb and in contigs is 1.97 Gb.

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>

Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" super-structures,in order to present complete genes. There are 5871 such gene scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".

<h4>Mammalian Genome Project</h4>
<p>
<i>Otolemur garnettii</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part
of the Mammalian Genome Project, funded by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch
length of the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of
mammalian species. Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these
mammals and used in alignments for cross-species comparison. The aim is
to increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the
human genome.
