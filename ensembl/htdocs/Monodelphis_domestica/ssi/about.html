This site presents the first preliminary genome assembly (version 0.5) of the gray short-tailed opossum.</p>

<p>The assembly, from the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">Broad Institute</a>, has a base coverage of approximately 7.19X, constructed from 19348 supercontigs, having N50 length 4047488.  The total contig length is 3492108230, spanning 3559101070 bases (including gaps)

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>The gene set for Opossum was built using a modified version of the 
standard Ensembl genebuild pipeline. The species-specific sequence 
resources (opossum cDNA and protein) are very limited, so the vast 
majority of gene models are based on genewise alignments of proteins 
from other species. Most of the proteins being aligned were from 
species genetically distant to opossum. To improve the accuracy of 
models generated from these proteins, the genewise alignments were made 
to stretches of genomic sequence rather than to 'miniseqs'. Opossum and 
human cDNAs were aligned and used to add UTRs to the genewise 
predictions where possible. The gene models were assessed by generating 
sets of potential orthologs to genes from other mammalian species. 
Potentially missing predictions and partial gene predictions were 
identified by examining the orthologs, and exonerate used to build new 
gene models for these based on the human ortholog peptide sequence.</p>
