<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>
The gene set for lamprey was built using the Ensembl pipeline. Gene models 
are based on genewise alignments of lamprey proteins and most proteins from 
Uniprot, whether vertebrate or more genetically distant species. The protein 
based gene models were then extended using lamprey cDNA. To improve the 
accuracy of models generated from distant species, transcriptome data was 
used to filter out the different gene models. In addition to the coding 
transcript models, non-coding RNAs and pseudogenes were annotated
