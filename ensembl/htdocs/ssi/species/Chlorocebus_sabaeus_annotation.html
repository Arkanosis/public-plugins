<p>The gene set was built using a mixed approach. Due to the lack of 
species-specific sequences and the availability of RNASeq data for 
Vervet-AGM from Washington University, the final gene set comprises 
models based on orthologous proteins from the vertebrate division of 
UniProtKB, longest translations of some human gene models from Ensembl 73, 
as well as models from RNASeq data.</p>

<p>11,258 gene models were made exclusively from RNASeq data. The data were 
also used to add UTR to gene models. The total gene set contains 10165 
protein-coding genes with a further 8,218 ncRNAs and 505 pseudogenes.</p>
