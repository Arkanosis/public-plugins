<p class="space-below">UMD 2.0 is an assembly of the domesticated turkey genome. The first sequences have been generated with the GS-Titanium platform in VBI's (<a href="https://www.vbi.vt.edu/">Virginia Bioinformatics Institute</a>) Core Lab.
Additionnally, the USDA (<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?MODECODE=12-00-00-00">United States Department of
Agriculture</a>) Beltsville group provided 30x coverage with
Illumina 70 bp reads. And the Salzberg group at UMD (<a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/">University
of MarylandM</a>) assisted with assembly and annotation of the
integrated 454/Illumina/BAC end sequence data set into a "draft
genome sequence".</p>

<p>The whole composite covers 90% of the genome.
The turkey genome is composed of 33 chromosomes, assembled from
176.691 contigs.
The total number of bases in the genome is 1.08Gb.</p>
