<p>The gene set was built using a mixed approach. Due to the lack of 
species-specific sequences and the availability of RNASeq data for 
Amazon molly from Washington University, the final gene set comprises 
models based on orthologous proteins from the vertebrate division of 
UniProtKB, longest translations of some stickleback gene models from 
Ensembl 73, as well as models from RNASeq data.</p>

<p>8162 gene models were made exclusively from RNASeq data. The data 
were also used to add UTR to gene models. The total gene set contains 
23615 protein-coding genes with a further 679 ncRNAs and 60 pseudogenes.</p>
