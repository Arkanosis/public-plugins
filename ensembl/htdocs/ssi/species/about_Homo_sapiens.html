<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p class="space-below">
<img src="/img/species/pic_Homo_sapiens.png" style="width:100px;height:97px" class="float-right" alt="Homo sapiens" title="doh!"/>This site provides a data set based on the February 2009 <i>Homo sapiens</i> 
high coverage assembly from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/index.shtml">Genome Reference Consortium.</a>
The data set consists of gene models built from the genewise alignments 
of the human proteome as well as from alignments of human cDNAs using 
the cDNA2genome model of exonerate.</p>
<p class="space-below">This release of the assembly has the following properties: </p>
<ul style="margin-left:150px">
    <li>27478 contigs.</li>
    <li>contig length total 3.2 Gb.</li>
    <li>chromosome length total 3.1 Gb.</li>
</ul>
<p class="space-below">It also includes nine <a href="/Homo_sapiens/Info/Content?file=haplotypes.html">haplotypic regions</a>, 
mainly in the MHC region of chromosome 6.</p>

<p>As the GRC maintains and improves the assembly, patches have been 
introduced. In Ensembl release 59, the patches in <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/GRCh37/PATCHES/patch_release_1/">patch release one</a> 
from the GRC have been added to the assembly. Currently, assembly 
patches are of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Novel patch: new sequences that add alternative sequence at a loci 
and will remain as haplotypes in the next major assembly release by GRC</li>
<li>Fix patch: sequences that correct the reference sequence and will 
replace the given region of the reference assembly at the next major 
assembly release by GRC</li>
</ul>

<p>Mitochondrial (MT) sequence NC_012920 has also been loaded.</p>

<h3 style="clear:both">Annotation</h3>

<p class="space-below">In release 57 (March 2010), we continue to display a joint gene set based on the merge between the automatic annotation from Ensembl and the 
manually curated annotation from <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/havana">Havana</a>.
This refined gene set corresponds to
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/PostGenomics/encode/">GENCODE</a> release 4.The Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) identifiers have also been mapped to the annotations. More information about the CCDS project is available <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/genebuild/ccds.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the mitochondrial (MT) sequence has been replaced by the correct MT sequence, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/251831106">NC_012920</a>.</p><br />
