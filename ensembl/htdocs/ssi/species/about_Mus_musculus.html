<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p>Ensembl Mouse is based on the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.cgi?taxid=10090">
NCBI m37 mouse assembly</a> (April 2007, strain C57BL/6J).

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Mus_musculus.png" style="height:80px;width:130px" class="float-right" alt="Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium" title="squeak squeak!" />The Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium is a joint project between 
<a href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/">The Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research</a>, 
<a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">The Washington University Genome Sequencing Center</a>, 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> 
and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL - EBI</a> to provide the Mouse genome sequence to the world. 
We work closely with other Mouse groups to provide an integrated resource (see below for credits).</p>
      
<p>There are some major changes in the assembly from version m36; for more details see 
the <a

<h3>Annotation</h3>


<p>As in previous releases since October 2007, we provide a combined Ensembl-HAVANA gene set, where Ensembl annotations and HAVANA annotations from the <a href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Mus_musculus/Info/Index">Vega database</a> are merged at the transcript level. Improvement to the Ensembl-HAVANA merging code means that in release 59,<br />we incorporated not only 28851 full-length protein-coding transcripts from HAVANA annotation into the Ensembl annotation, but also over 30000 HAVANA non-coding transcripts. Protein-coding transcripts from the two annotation sources were merged if they shared the same coding region,<br />while non-coding transcripts were merged if they shared identical exon-intron structures.</p><br />

<p>There are 36536 genes and 88186 transcripts in the combined gene set. Of the 88186 transcripts, 17.82% (15711) are the result of merging Ensembl and HAVANA annotations, 22.55% (19890) are found only in Ensembl, 52.62% (46401) are found only in HAVANA, and a remaining 7% were incorporated from other sources (e.g. immunoglobulin gene segments/transcripts imported from <a href="http://imgt.cines.fr/">IMGT</a> data).</p><br />

<p>Since September 2006, the mouse genome sequence has been considered sufficiently stable to start identifying those gene placements that are identical in the three major genome browsers. The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi">CCDS project</a> was established and Ensembl is collaborating with HAVANA,<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/">NCBI</a> and <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC</a> to identify a core set of protein coding regions that are consistently annotated and of high quality. All CCDS annotations (as of October 2009) are included in the Ensembl-HAVANA gene set, and the CCDS identifiers are shown where applicable.</p><br />
