<p>
The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments 
and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). 
For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate 
set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and 
quality of the alignments. Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. 
Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns 
(introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and 
evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.
