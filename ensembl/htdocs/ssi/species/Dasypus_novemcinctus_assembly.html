<p>
This is the new release of the draft assembly of the armadillo (<i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i>) genome, Dasnov3.0, provided by the <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/" rel="external">Baylor College of Medicine</a> in Dec 2011.
There are 46,558 scaffolds comprised of 314,971 contigs with a scaffold N50 of 1,717,291b and a contig N50 of 26,277b. 
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>
The aim is to increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the human genome. 
Dasypus novemcinctus is of particular interest to developmental biologists owing to its habit of producing litters of four genetically-identical young, and it is also the animal model for leprosy.
