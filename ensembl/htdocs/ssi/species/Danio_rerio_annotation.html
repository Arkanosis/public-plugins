<p class="space-below">The zebrafish Zv9 assembly was annotated using a 
modified Ensembl pipeline. Predictions from zebrafish proteins have been 
given priority over predictions from other non-mammalian vertebrate species. 
All Uniprot proteins were filtered to remove predictions ( PE levels 3 and above ). 
Aligned zebrafish cDNAs have been used to add UTR regions.7,890 RNASeq models made 
from a range of zebrafish developmental stages and tissues were added into 
the gene build where they added a novel model or splice variant.Genes are 
named based on the alignment of their coding regions to known entries 
in public databases; ZFIN genes have priority in this process.</p>

<p class="space-below">The final gene-set comprises 24,020 protein-coding genes and 38 genes that have been identified as pseudogenes.</p>
