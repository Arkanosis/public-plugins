The Felis_catus_8.0 assembly was submitted by the International Cat Genome Sequencing Consortium 
on 2014/11/7. The assembly is chromosome level, with a total of 19 chromosomes. 
There are 267,927 scaffolds and 367,671 contigs. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the 
assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 
45,189 while the scaffold N50 is 18,072,971.
