<p>Annotation was performed using the EnsEMBL annotation pipeline, with the gene set being supplemented by the projection of orthologous genes and the inclusion of genes based on alignments with lower coverage than usual. The gene set contains 15,634 protein coding genes, 249 pseudogenes and 567 ncRNAs.</p>
