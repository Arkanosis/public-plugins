<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p>The gene set for <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> was built using a modified 
version of the standard Ensembl pipeline. Both <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> and 
<i>Xenopus laevis</i> proteins were used to predict gene structures. 
cDNAs from both species were used to add UTRs. Gene predictions were also 
based on <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> cDNAs manually annotated in the July 2005 
jamboree. Finally, gene predictions based on UniProt proteins were used to fill
gaps in the annotation.</p>
