The AnoCar1.0 assembly is a Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) assembly at
6.3x. The Green anole lizard, <i>Anolis carolinensis</i>, is the first
reptilian genome to be sequenced. The project coordination, genome
sequencing and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the contigs is
83.2 kb and the N50 of the scaffolds is 2399.2 kb. The total length of
all contigs is 1.74 Gb. When the gaps between contigs in scaffolds are
included, the total span of the assembly is 1.77 Gb.</p>
