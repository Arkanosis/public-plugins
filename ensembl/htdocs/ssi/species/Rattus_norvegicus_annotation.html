<p>The Rat Rnor_6.0 assembly was annotated using a mixed approach, with the 
standard Ensembl gene annotation system and the Ensembl RNASeq pipeline. 
The RNASeq data set contains 12 samples: liver, muscle, brain, heart, thymus, 
blood, testis, ovary, kidney, skin, spleen and lung. The HAVANA manual annotation 
team at the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute</a> provided a 
high quality gene set on gene clusters which are hard to annotate in an automated 
pipeline. The final gene set contain 1,030 Ensembl-HAVANA merged genes, 30,893 Ensembl only genes and 585 HAVANA only genes.

<h3>RNAseq dataset</h3>

<p>In addition to the main set, we have predicted gene models for each tissue type 
using the RNASeq pipeline. We did a BLASTp of these models against UniProt proteins 
of protein existence level 1 and 2, in order to confirm the open reading frame (ORF). 
The best BLAST hit is displayed as a transcript supporting evidence.</p>

<p>The tissue-specific sets of transcript models built using our RNAseq pipeline are as follows:</p>
