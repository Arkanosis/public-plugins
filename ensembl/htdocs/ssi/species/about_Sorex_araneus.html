<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p class="space-below">This is the first release of the low-coverage 1.9X assembly of the
common shrew or European shrew (<i>Sorex araneus</i>). The genome sequencing
and assembly is provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is
18.74 kb and is 3.17 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in
supercontigs is 2.93 Gb and in contigs is 1.83 Gb.

<h3>Annotation</h3>
<p>Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" super-structures, in order to present complete genes. There are 7368 such gene-scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".

<h3>Mammalian Genome Project</h3>
<p><i>Sorex araneus</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the
Mammalian Genome Project, funded by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH). A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch length of
the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian
species. Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals
and used in alignments for cross-species comparison. The aim is to
increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the
human genome.
