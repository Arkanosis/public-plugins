<p>
The mouse primary assembly GRCm38 was annotated using Ensembl's automatic annotation system. This includes an updated mouse-specific repeat library, RefSeq and Uniprot protein sequence data for annotating the coding regions of protein-coding genes, as well as mouse cDNAs and ESTs for annotation untranslated regions (UTRs) of protein-coding genes.
</p>

<p>In the current release, we continue to display a
      joint gene set based on the merge between the automatic annotation from
      Ensembl and the manually curated annotation from <a href="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/index.html">Havana</a>.
      See the statistics table, right, for the corresponding GENCODE version number.
      The Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) identifiers have also been mapped to the
      annotations. More information about the <a
        href="/info/genome/genebuild/ccds.html">CCDS project.</a></p>

<p>Updated manual
      annotation from Havana is merged into the Ensembl annotation every
      release. Transcripts from the two annotation sources are merged if they
      share the same internal exon-intron boundaries (i.e. have identical
      splicing pattern) with slight differences in the terminal exons
      allowed. Importantly, all Havana transcripts are included in the final
      Ensembl/Havana merged (GENCODE) gene set.

<p>
In addition to the gene set, we display alignments of mouse cDNA and EST sequences. The mouse cDNA alignments are updated for every Ensembl release. We also display alignments of sequences from UniProt, UniGene and the ENA vertebrate RNA collection, and ab initio gene predictions from Genscan.
