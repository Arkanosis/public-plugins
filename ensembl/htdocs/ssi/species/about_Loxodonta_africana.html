<p class="space-below">loxAfr3 is the latest x7 assembly 
of the genome of the African Elephant (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>).  
The genome sequencing and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">Broad Institute</a>.</p>

<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in 
blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is 69 
kb.
The total length of all contigs is 3.12Gb, and the total length of
all supercontigs is 3.2 Gb

<p>
The gene set for elephant was built using the Ensembl pipeline.
Gene models are based on genewise alignments of rodent proteins
as well are genetically distant proteins from other species,
including most vertebrate proteins from Uniprot. Additionally,
mouse proteins were aligned using exonerate. Potentially missing
predictions and partial gene predictions were identified by
examining the orthologs, which were then used to build new gene models.
