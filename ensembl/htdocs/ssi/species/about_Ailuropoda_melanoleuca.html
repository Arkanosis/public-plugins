<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p class="space-below">ailMel1 is an assembly of the giant panda, <i>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</i>. 
It was sequenced to a 6.8x coverage using a three-year-old female panda at China's Chengdu
breeding centre. The genome sequencing and assembly are provided by
the <a href="http://english.big.cas.cn/">Beijing Genomics Institute</a> (BGI).</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome
lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 size of the
scaffolds is 1.3Mb. The total length of all scaffolds is 2.3Gb, for
a genome size estimated to be 2.4Gb.</p>

<h3>Annotation</h3>
<p class="space-below">
The gene set for panda was built using the Ensembl pipeline.
Gene models are based on genewise alignments of mammal proteins as
well as genetically distance proteins from other species, including
most vertebrate proteins from Uniprot. Additionally, dog and human
proteins were aligned using exonerate.</p>
<p>Potentially missing predictions and partial gene predictions were
identified by examining the orthologs, which were then used to build
new gene models.</p>
