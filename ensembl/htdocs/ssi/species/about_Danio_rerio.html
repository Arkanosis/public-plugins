<p>The <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/">zebrafish
genome project</a> is a collaboration between the Sanger Institute and
the zebrafish community, announced during the <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2000/001121.shtml">Sanger Institute
Zebrafish Workshop 2000</a> and was started in February 2001.</p>

<p class="space-below">Zv9 is the ninth integrated assembly of the zebrafish 
genome. It is based on nearly 90% clone sequence (data freeze April 2010), 
with remaining gaps being filled using sequence from a novel whole genome 
shotgun assembly, WGS31. The project coordination, genome sequencing and 
assembly is provided by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>

<p>An overview of the assembly is available <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv9_assembly_information.shtml">here</a>, and frequently asked 
questions about the assembly process and terminology are addressed <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/faqs.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p class="space-below">The zebrafish Zv9 assembly was annotated using a 
modified Ensembl pipeline. Predictions from zebrafish proteins have been 
given priority over predictions from other non-mammalian vertebrate species. 
All Uniprot proteins were filtered to remove predictions ( PE levels 3 and above ). 
Aligned zebrafish cDNAs have been used to add UTR regions.7,890 RNASeq models made 
from a range of zebrafish developmental stages and tissues were added into 
the gene build where they added a novel model or splice variant.Genes are 
named based on the alignment of their coding regions to known entries 
in public databases; ZFIN genes have priority in this process.</p>

<p class="space-below">The final gene-set comprises 24,020 protein-coding genes and 38 genes that have been identified as pseudogenes.</p>

<div class="alert-box">
<h2>Missing genes</h2>
<p>Due to an error in gene clustering we have identified approximately 750 genes, mostly from clusters of gene families, that are missing from this gene build. We are working to restore these genes for the next release, which will include a merged Ensembl Havana gene set.</p>
