<p>The <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio">zebrafish
genome project</a> is a collaboration between the Sanger Institute and
the zebrafish community, announced during the <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Info/Press/001121.shtml">Sanger Institute
Zebrafish Workshop 2000</a> and was started in February 2001.</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p class="space-below">Zv8 is the eighth integrated Whole Genome Shotgun 
(WGS) assembly of the zebrafish genome at a coverage of 6.5-7x.
The project coordination and genome sequencing and assembly is provided 
by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>

<p class="space-below">The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the 
assembled genome lies in blocks of N50 size or longer. The N50 size of 
the 247,928 contigs is 20,629bp. There are 105,987 supercontigs in the 
WGS assembly with an N50 size of 687,451bp.

More information about the assembling process, and further statistics
</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>:
This is still a <em>preliminary</em> assembly. The regions of the assembly 
covered by WGS contigs are of lower quality. The assembly will still 
contain misjoins, misassemblies and artificial duplications due to 
retention of haplotypic sequences are likely to occur. During the 
generation of Zv8, particular attention has been paid to improving the 
order of the clone path.</p>

<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p class="space-below">The zebrafish Zv8 assembly was annotated using a 
modified Ensembl pipeline. Predictions from zebrafish proteins have been 
given priority over predictions from other vertebrate species. 
Aligned zebrafish cDNAs have been used to add UTR regions. Genes are named 
based on the alignment of their coding regions to known entries in 
public databases; ZFIN genes have priority in this process.</p>

<p class="space-below">The final gene-set comprises 24,147 
protein-coding genes, 80 genes that have been identified as pseudogenes, 
and 6 retrotransposed gene predictions. The prediction of ncRNA 
genes will added for the ensembl 55 release.</p>
