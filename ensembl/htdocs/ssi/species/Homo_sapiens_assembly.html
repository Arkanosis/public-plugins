<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p class="space-below">
<img src="/img/species/pic_Homo_sapiens.png" style="width:100px;height:97px" class="float-right" alt="Homo sapiens" title="doh!"/>This site provides a data set based on the February 2009 <i>Homo sapiens</i> 
high coverage assembly (Hg19) from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/index.shtml">Genome Reference Consortium.</a>
The data set consists of gene models built from the genewise alignments 
of the human proteome as well as from alignments of human cDNAs using 
the cDNA2genome model of exonerate.</p>
<p class="space-below">This release of the assembly has the following properties: </p>
<ul style="margin-left:150px">
    <li>27478 contigs.</li>
    <li>contig length total 3.2 Gb.</li>
    <li>chromosome length total 3.1 Gb.</li>
</ul>
<p class="space-below">It also includes nine <a href="/Homo_sapiens/Info/Content?file=haplotypes.html">haplotypic regions</a>, 
mainly in the MHC region of chromosome 6.</p>

<p>As the GRC maintains and improves the assembly, patches are being introduced. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/human/index.shtml">Patch release two (GRCh37.p2)</a> was included in Ensembl release 60. Currently, assembly patches are of two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Novel patch: new sequences that add alternative sequence at a loci 
and will remain as haplotypes in the next major assembly release by GRC</li>
<li>Fix patch: sequences that correct the reference sequence and will 
replace the given region of the reference assembly at the next major 
assembly release by GRC</li>
</ul>

<br/><p>
The addition of the patches allows the annotation of some genes that can not be annotated correctly on the reference genome, such as the 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000175164;r=9:136130563-136150630">ABO blood group gene</a>, which can now be annotated as a 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=otherfeatures;g=ASMPATCHG00000000052;r=HG79_PATCH:136049442-136379605;t=ASMPATCHT00000000052">protein coding gene</a>.</p>
