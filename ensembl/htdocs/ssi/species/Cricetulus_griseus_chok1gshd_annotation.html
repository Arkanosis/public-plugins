<p>The Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus), is a species of hamster originating from the deserts of northern China and Mongolia. More information on the Horizon Discovery CHO-K1 GS null cell line can be found on the following poster: <a href="https://www.horizondiscovery.com/media/resources/Posters/bioproduction/Building%20on%20GS%20Engineering%20the%20next%20generation%20CHO%20cell%20platform.pdf">Building on GS Engineering the next generation CHO cell platform.pdf</a>

<p>The gene annotation process is carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available).

For candidate genic region, a selection process was applied to chose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.

Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of <10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.

lincRNAs will be provided in a future release.</p>
