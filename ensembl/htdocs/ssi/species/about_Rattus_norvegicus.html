<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Rattus_norvegicus.png" style="height:75px;width:140px" class="float-left" alt="Rat" title="eeeeek! eeeek!" />The latest build provides a preliminary data set based on the version 3.4 "November 2004 Update" of the rat genome assembly. In this update a 15 bp overhang was removed at the join between AABR03100354-AC117058 and the order was reversed for BACs AC133000 and AC136926. </p>
    
<p>The Rat Genome project is an international collaboration to sequence
	the genome of the brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>).  The DNA
	sequence is generated by <a

	Medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.celera.com">Celera Genomics</a>, <a
	href="http://www.genomecorp.com">Genome Therapeutics</a>, <a
	href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/bac_ends/rat/bac_end_intro.html">The
	Institute for Genome Research</a>, and <a
	href="http://www.bcgsc.bc.ca">The University of British
	Columbia</a>.</p>
	
<p>The rat data used on this site can be downloaded directly from <a

<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>Ensembl is working with the broader rat genomics community (<a
	href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/">RGD</a>) to provide annotation of the rat
	genome. We have also participated in the <a href="star/">STAR consortium</a> to help  
identify and map single nucleotide polymorphisms in the rat.</p>
<p>The latest release (August 2006) uses a new rat-specific repeat library, 
and takes advantage of additional cDNAs and ESTs which have been published since 
the original RGSC 3.4 genebuild, with the result that around 1800 new gene predictions 
have been added. </p>
