<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Rattus_norvegicus.png" style="height:75px;width:140px" class="float-left" alt="Rat" title="eeeeek! eeeek!" />The latest release (September 2009) provides a new Ensembl genebuild on the existing RGSC 3.4 assembly.In release 57 (March 2010), the mitochondrial sequence has been replaced with the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001665">NC_001665</a> sequence.</p>
    
<p>The Rat Genome project is an international collaboration to sequence
	the genome of the brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>).  The DNA
	sequence is generated by <a

	Medicine</a>, <a href="http://www.celera.com">Celera Genomics</a>, <a
	href="http://www.genomecorp.com">Genome Therapeutics</a>, <a
	href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/bac_ends/rat/bac_end_intro.html">The
	Institute for Genome Research</a>, and <a

	Columbia</a>.</p>

<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>Ensembl is working with the broader rat genomics community (<a
	href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/">RGD</a>) to provide annotation of the rat
	genome. We have also participated in the <a href="/Rattus_norvegicus/Info/Content?file=star/index.html">STAR consortium</a> to help  
identify and map single nucleotide polymorphisms in the rat.</p>

<p>The Rat RGSC 3.4 assembly was annotated using the standard Ensembl GeneBuild pipeline.  
To improve the gene set, we have incorporated new data resources which have become available 
since the last RGSC 3.4 genebuild (August 2006), including an updated rat-specific repeat 
library, additional RefSeq and Uniprot protein sequence data for predicting the coding 
regions of protein-coding genes, as well as new cDNAs and ESTs for annotating untranslated 
regions (UTRs) of protein-coding genes.  This results in the extension of previously 
partially-predicted genes, merging of genes which were previously mis-annotated as two 
distinct neighbouring genes, and the recovery of new rat genes with mammalian orthologues.</p>
