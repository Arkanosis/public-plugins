<p>
The sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>) genome was produced by the International Sheep Genome Consortium (<a href="http://www.livestockgenomics.csiro.au/sheep/" rel="external">ISGC</a>). 
A single Texel ewe and a single Texel ram were sequenced using Illumina technology. 
The assembly is based on the Texel ewe data set. The Texel ram data set and Roche 454 reads from the previous assembly v1.0 (ACIV000000000) were used to fill in the gaps. 
39,042 SNP markers and Ovine SNP50 genotyping linkage data were used to check scaffold integrity and to anchor scaffolds and super-scaffolds to chromosomes.

<p>
The assembly comprises 5,697 toplevel sequences from 130,765 contigs, 27 chromosomes (including the X chromosome). 
The N50 of the contigs is 40.4 kb and the N50 of the scaffolds is 100.1 Mb. 
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.
