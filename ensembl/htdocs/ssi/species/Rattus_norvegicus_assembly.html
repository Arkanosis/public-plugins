<p>This site displays annotation on version 6.0 (July 2014) of the rat 
(mixed female BN/SsNHsdMCW and male SHR) genome assembly, known as 'Rnor_6.0', submitted from the
<a href="https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/content/rat-genome-project">Rat Genome Sequencing Consortium</a>.</p>

<p>This assembly is based on a 6X WGS sequence approach (as used for the mouse genome), 
10X PacBio data set and the hierarchical (BAC clone) approach used for the human genome.
It is composed of 2738 toplevel sequences, of which 22 are chromosomes, 354 are 
unlocalized scaffolds and 578 are unplaced scaffolds. There are 75,697 contigs with 
an N50 length of 100.5kb, and 1,395 scaffolds with an N50 length of 14.99Mb.
The Y chromosome is now present in the assembly.</p>
