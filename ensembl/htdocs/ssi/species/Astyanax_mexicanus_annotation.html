<p>
The gene set was built using a mixed approach. Due to the lack of species specific sequences and the availability of RNASeq data for blind cave fish from Washington University, the final gene set comprises models based on orthologous proteins from the vertebrate division of UniProtKB, longest translations of some stickleback and zebrafish gene models from Ensembl 72, as well as models from RNASeq data.

<p>
The RNASeq data only contained samples from the entire organism, not individual tissues. 13,097 gene models were made exclusively from RNASeq data. The data were also used to add UTR to gene models. The total gene set contains 23,042 protein-coding genes with a further 709 ncRNAs and 21 pseudogenes.
