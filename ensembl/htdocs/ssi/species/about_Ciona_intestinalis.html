<p class="space-below"><i>Ciona intestinalis</i> version 2.0 
[<a href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Cioin2/Cioin2.info.html">details</a>] 
is a whole genome shotgun assembly released by the JGI. 
The <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> genome is the smallest of any experimentally 
manipulable chordate, and thus provides a good system for exploring vertebrate 
evolutionary origins. This Ensembl website presents the sequence data provided 
by the JGI, with additional Ensembl genebuild (see below).</p>
         
<p class="space-below">The assembly release version 2.0 of the whole genome shotgun reads was 
constructed with the JAZZ assembly, using paired end sequencing reads. 
Starting with a coverage of 11x, additional data--including BAC and FISH 
markers--were used to map scaffolds to chromosome arms. The current size of 
the assembly (which includes unmapped scaffolds) is 173Mb, with 94Mb of 
the assembly mapped to chromosome arms.</p>
    

<h3 style="clear:left">Annotation</h3>

<p>The standard Ensembl mammalian pipeline was modified for annotation of 
the <i>Ciona</i> genome, owing to the lack of genomic information from 
closely related species. Thus, in addition to aligning known <i>Ciona</i> 
proteins to the sequence (as per the standard pipeline), we aligned the 
large quantities of Ciona-specific cDNA and EST sequences against the genome, 
and then used protein data from other species to build additional gene models.</p>
