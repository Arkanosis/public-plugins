Sscrofa10.2 was annotated using the standard Ensembl automatic gene
annotation system, incorporating RNA-Seq data provided by the
(<a href="http://piggenome.org/">SGSC</a>).
The annotation process is described in the document below. The Ensembl
annotations were then merged with Vega annotations at the transcript
level. Transcripts were merged if they shared the same internal
exon-intron boundaries (i.e. had identical splicing pattern) with slight
differences in the terminal exons allowed. Importantly, all Vega source
transcripts were included in the final merged gene set. The Vega
annotations comprised manual annotation of 2,000 genes both from Havana
and from the Immune Response Annotation Group
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308165/">IRAG</a>)
community annotation initiative, which was performed under the guidance
of the Havana group.
