<p class="space-below">UMD2 is a provisional assembly of the 
genome of the domesticated turkey <em>Meleagris gallopavo</em>. The first
sequences have been generated with the GS-Titanium platform in
VBI's (<a href="https://www.vbi.vt.edu/">Virginia Bioinformatics Institute</a>) 
Core Lab. Additionally, the USDA 
(<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?MODECODE=12-00-00-00">United States Department of
Agriculture</a>) Beltsville group provided 30x coverage with
Illumina 70 bp reads, and the Salzberg group at UMD 
(<a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>) 
assisted with assembly and annotation of the
integrated 454/Illumina/BAC end sequence data set into a "draft
genome sequence". The whole composite covers 90% of the genome.</p>

<p>The assembly is provisory, and therefore only composed of
scaffolds.
There are 27007 scaffold sequences, with a genome length of 1Gb.
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome
lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for
scaffolds is 1.5 Mb. The total number of bases in scaffolds is
1.02 Gb.</p> 

<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>The gene set for turkey was built using the Ensembl genebuild
pipeline. Gene models are based on genewise alignments of
chicken proteins as well as genetically distant proteins from
other species. To improve the accuracy of models generated from
distant species, the Genewise alignments were made to stretches
of genomic sequence rather than to 'miniseqs'. The protein based
gene models were then extended using turkey cDNA and EST
alignments as well as chicken cDNA. The resulting gene models
were then assessed by generating sets of potential orthologs to
genes from other vertebrate species. Potentially missing
predictions and partial gene predictions were identified by
examining the orthologs, which were then used to build new gene
models.
