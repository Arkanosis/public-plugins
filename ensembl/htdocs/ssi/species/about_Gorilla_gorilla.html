This is the second release of the draft assembly of the Western lowland gorilla 
<em>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</em>. The DNA sample came from a 30-year-old female, 
Kamilah, owned by the San Diego Wild Animal Park, 
and sequencing and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Welcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>.
</p>

<p class="space-below">Sequencing was undertaken using two separate methods: whole-genome
shotgun (WGS) sequencing and Solexa new-technology sequencing. Results
from the two methods were used in both the first and second draft
gorilla assemblies.</p>

<p class="space-below">The first draft assembly was released in September 2008. This initial draft 
assembly was a 2.1x coverage assembly, created from WGS capillary reads using the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/production/phusion/">Phusion assembler</a>,
with these capillary reads' sequencing errors being corrected by taking the 
consensus of Solexa data aligned to it.</p>

<p class="space-below">To create the second draft assemby, Solexa data, sequenced at roughly 35x,
was assembled into contigs using 
<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/6/1117.full">Abyss</a>.
The resulting contigs of length 50bp or longer were then assembled along with
the WGS capillary data using the Phusion assembler. Next, the Solexa read pairs
were aligned to the human reference genome using
<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/11/1851.full">Maq</a> to identify 
syntenic regions and breakpoints between human and gorilla. Using human-gorilla 
synteny as a guide, longer gorilla supercontigs were constructed using
<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/5/821.full">Velvet</a> and other
assembly tools, resulting in the second draft assembly.</p>
 
<p>The total length of the assembly is 3.03Gb. The total number of capillary reads 
used in the assembly after clean-up is 7901471; the N50 size for contigs is
11,657 bp and the N50 size for supercontigs is 913,458 bp.</p>

<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>
Gene annotation in gorilla has been generated by projection of genes from the human 
reference genome as well as alignment of proteins from three major sources (in 
descending order of their contribution to the final gene set):
</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensembl human translations from Ensembl release 56</li>
<li>Uniprot mammalian and vertebrate proteins with evidence at either the protein 
or transcript level for their existence; and</li>
<li><em>Gorilla gorilla</em> proteins obtained from UniprotKB.</li>
</ol>

<p class="space-below">
Projection of human genes to gorilla began with the alignment of the gorilla genome to 
the latest human reference genome (GRCh37 assembly) using BLASTz. These alignments were 
used to project human Ensembl gene structures (Ensembl version 56) to the corresponding 
location in gorilla. About 60% of human protein-coding genes were projected onto the 
gorilla genome. Small insertions/deletions that disrupt the reading-frame of the resultant 
projected transcripts are corrected for by inserting "frame-shift" introns into the structure. 
For some human exons and parts of exons, the corresponding gorilla sequence is missing from 
the assembly. In most of these cases, the missing exon is omitted from the gorilla gene model. 
In a small number of cases however, where BLASTz has aligned the human sequence to a gap 
in the gorilla sequence, the exon is placed in the gap, resulting in a run of X's of the 
correct length in the translation.
</p>

<p class="space-below">
Ensembl human translations were also aligned to the gorilla genome using Exonerate.  The 
alignment of mammalian/vertebrate proteins and gorilla-specific proteins followed procedures 
in the standard Ensembl genebuild pipeline using Genewise.
</p>

<p class="space-below">
The gene-building procedure on the gorGor2 assembly identified 20805 protein coding genes 
and 1553 pseudogenes.
