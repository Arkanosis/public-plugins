This is the first release of the draft assembly of the Western lowland gorilla 
<em>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</em>. The DNA sample came from a 30-year-old female, 
Kamilah, owned by the San Diego Wild Animal Park, 
and sequencing and assembly is provided by the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Welcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>.
</p>

<p>Sequencing was undertaken using two separate methods, the results
of which were combined to create the first full <em>de novo</em>
gorilla assembly. Firstly, traditional capillary sequencing was used
to provide a 2X assembly and assembled using the 
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/production/phusion/">Phusion assembler</a>. 
Secondly the genome was sequenced using the newer
Illumina machines, which provide a high depth of coverage but in much 
shorter reads. The Illumina reads were then mapped onto the assembly,
enabling the identification and removal of sequencing errors and
contamination; a wide range of viral and other contaminants were identified,
leading to a cleaner, more accurate draft assembly.
</p>
<p>The total number of capillary reads used in the assembly after 
clean-up is 7901471; the N50 size for contigs is
2094 bp and the N50 size for supercontigs is 11277 bp.</p>

<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>
Owing to the fragmentary nature of this assembly, it was necessary to 
arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" super-structures, in order 
to present complete genes. There are 9673 such gene-scaffolds, with 
identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1". The gorGor1 assembly contains 
1366111 contigs and 609860 scaffolds.

<p>
The gene-building procedure on assembly version gorGor1 identified 
16724 protein coding genes and 472 pseudogenes as well as miRNA genes, 
misc_RNA genes, and rRNA, snoRNA and snRNA genes.
