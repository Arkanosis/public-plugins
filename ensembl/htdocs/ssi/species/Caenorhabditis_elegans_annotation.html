<p class="space-below">
      Genome sequence and annotation have been imported from the WS230 release
      of WormBase (which includes the WBcel215 version of the C.elegans
      reference genome). Included are annotated operons, genes, transcripts and
      translations, as well as RNAi and BLAST/BLAT homology data. In addition
      Affymetrix and Agilent cross references for C.elegans expression arrays
      have been added.</p>

<p class="space-below">
      We include C.elegans in Ensembl (and also Ensembl Genomes) to allow people to
      access the data through the Ensembl user interface (both for visualisation
      and data mining) and to provide cross-species integration through our
      comparative genomics resources (such as homologous gene links and protein
      family pages).</p>
