<h3>Assembly and Annotation</h3>

The data on this site is a direct import of the <a href="http://ws210.wormbase.org/">WormBase WS210</a> frozen dataset. Included are annotated operons, genes, transcripts and CDSs as well as RNAi and BLAST/BLAT homology data. Information about the location of available fosmid clones is also included. In addition Affymetrix and Agilent cross references for <i>C.elegans</i> expression arrays have been added.</p>

<p class="space-below">The WS210 dataset is the anniversary frozen release of WormBase C.elegans data. All data used in the frozen releases is available from the <a href="ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/data_freezes/">WormBase FTP site</a> and links to permanent websites can be found on the WormBase home page.</p>

<p>We have included <i>C.elegans</i> in the Ensembl system to allow people to access the data through the Ensembl user interface (both for visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species integration through our comparative genomics resources (such as homologous gene links and protein family pages).</p>
