<p>
After the previous zebrafish assembly (Zv9) was released in July 2010, the 
zebrafish genome sequence was given into the care of the 
<a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/areas/bioinformatics/grc/">GRC</a> 
for future improvement and maintenance. The GRC have recently produced GRCz10, 
which is the tenth zebrafish reference assembly.</p> 
<p>The previous assembly (Zv9), although of high quality, featured many gaps and 
suffered from sub-optimal long-range continuity. In order to overcome this, the GRC 
have sequenced more than 1500 additional BAC and fosmid clones and added them to the 
assembly.</p> 
<p>The most notable changes in the chromosome landscape since the previous assembly 
can be found on chromosome 4, which has gained about 15 Mb in length. Also, 94 of 112 
previously unplaced clone-contigs have now been placed on a chromosome. The current 
assembly contains a total sequence length of 1.37Gb with 2.09Mb of gaps. There are 
26 chromosomes (including the mitochondrion) and 3,399 scaffolds, composed of 
22,852 contigs with a scaffold N50 of 2.18Mb and a contig N50 of 1.232Mb. The N50 size 
is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.
