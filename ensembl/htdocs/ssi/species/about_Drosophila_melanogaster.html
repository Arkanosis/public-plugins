<h3>Assembly and Annotation</h3>

<p class="space-below">The data displayed on the Ensembl Fruitfly site is a compendium of data 
from different sources, including <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/">BDGP</a>, 
<a href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> and <a href="http://www.dhgp.org/">DHGP</a>.
The genomic sequence is based on BDGP assembly release 5, and annotations
displayed in Ensembl are imported from FlyBase release 5.13 (dated 
October 2008</a>). No additional gene build has been carried out, however blast 
hits and protein features have been computed through the Ensembl pipeline.</p>

<p class="space-below">We have included Drosophila into the Ensembl system to allow people to
access the Fly genome through the Ensembl user interface (both for
visualisation and data mining) and to provide cross-species integration
throught our comparative genomics resources (such as homologous gene links
and family pages).</p>

<p>The canonical data for Drosophila is managed at 
<a href="http://www.flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> and we are working in partnership 
with them to provide feedback on their resources.</p>
