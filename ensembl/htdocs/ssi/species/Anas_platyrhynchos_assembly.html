<p>This release features the first draft assembly of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) genome, BGI_duck_1.0, submitted by the State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing in April 2013. The assembly comprises 78487 toplevel sequences, all of which are unplaced scaffolds (from 227448 contigs). The N50 of the contigs is 26 kb and the N50 of the scaffolds is 1.2 Mb. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.</p>
