This site provides a data set based on the March 
2006 Pan_troglodytes-2.1 6x shotgun assembly from the Chimpanzee Sequencing 
Consortium headed by the <a href="http://www.genome.wustl.edu/">GSC</a> (St. Louis) 
and <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">The Broad Institute</a> (MIT).</p>  
   
<p>The chimpanzee 2.1 assembly is a merge of the initial  4X made in 
collaboration with the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard and an 
additional (2X) whole genome coverage from the WUGSC (St. Louis) 
utilizing a combination of whole genome plasmid reads as well as fosmid 
and BAC end sequences.</p>
 
<p>This release of the assembly has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>246876 contigs, having N50 length 30.8 Kb</li>
	<li>contig length total 2.92 Gb</li>
	<li>chromosome length total 3.35 Gb</li>
</ul>
