<p>Vervet-AGM (<i>Chlorocebus sabaeus</i>), also known as the
Vervet Monkey or African Green Monkey, is originally from 
West Africa but was introduced in the late 1600s to the Caribbean. 
The species is important in studying high blood pressure and AIDS, 
since it is a host for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). This 
release features the assembly ChlSab 1.1 (GCA_000409795.2), which 
became available in March 2014.</p>

<p>The assembly comprises 2,003 toplevel sequences (including 
21 chromosomes) from 162,723 contigs. The N50 of the scaffolds is 
81.8Mb. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled 
genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.</p>
