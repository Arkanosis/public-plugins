<h3>Assembly</h3>

Mmul_1 is a preliminary assembly of the rhesus monkey, <i>Macaca mulatta</i> 
using whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads from small and medium insert clones.
Several WGS libraries, with inserts of 2-4 kb and 10 kb, fosmids with ~35kb 
inserts, and BACs with 180kb inserts were used to produce the data.

<p>
The release was produced by the Macaque Genome Sequencing Consortium, led by
the <a href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/rmacaque/">Baylor College 
of Human Medicine</a>, melding 
three separate complementary assemblies (created using the Atlas, Celera and
PCAP systems). This involved iteratively splitting likely chimeric scaffolds
and joining together existing scaffolds where possible. Chimeric scaffolds 
(<100 total) were identified by breaks in synteny with the human genome, which
were confirmed to be artefacts by the other assemblies.</p> 


<p>This is a draft
sequence and may contain errors so users should exercise
caution. Typical errors in draft genome sequences include
misassemblies of repeated sequences, collapses of repeated regions,
and unmerged overlaps (e.g. due to polymorphisms) creating artificial
duplications. However base accuracy in contigs (contiguous blocks of
sequence) is usually very high with most errors near the ends of
contigs. [<a href ="ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/pub/data/Rmacaque/fasta/README02142006.txt">More about the assembly</a>].

<h3>Annotation</h3>

<p>The gene set for macaque was built using the Ensembl pipeline. The 
species-specific resources for macaque are relatively limited, so we 
decided to take a combined approach utilizing macaque's great similarity 
to human to aid our annotation efforts. The gene structures are mainly 
based on alignments to human and macaque protein data. Both macaque and 
human cDNAs were used to add UTR structures, and finally gene 
predictions based on Uniprot proteins and human cdnas were used to fill 
gaps in the annotation.</p>
