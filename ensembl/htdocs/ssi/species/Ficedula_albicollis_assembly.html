<p>The FicAlb_1.4 assembly was provided by Uppsala University in January 2012. The assembly comprises 21765 toplevel sequences, all of which are unplaced scaffolds (from 30359 contigs). The N50 of the contigs is 450 kb and the N50 of the scaffolds is 7.3 Mb. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.</p>
