<p>The Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line (<a href="https://www.horizondiscovery.com/bioproduction/cho-cells">CHO-K1S GS null</a>) assembly, covering more than 90% of the genome is provided by <a href="https://www.horizondiscovery.com/">Horizon Discovery</a> and <a href="www.sanger.ac.uk/">Welcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>. The strategy for the CHOseq project used a hybrid approach with Illumina short range, Illumina long range with Dovetail Chicago library and Bionanogenomics optical mapping to construct the genome. The assembly is on the Scaffold level, consisting of 71,598 contigs assembled into 8264 scaffolds.

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 97,133 while the scaffold N50 is 61,810,576.

The genome assembly represented here corresponds to GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_900186095.1</p>
