<p>
This is the first release of the low-coverage 1.93X assembly of the
mouse lemur (<i>Microcebus murinus</i>). The genome sequencing and assembly is
provided by the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu">Broad Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies 
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs is 
107.02 kb and is 3.51 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in 
supercontigs is 2.89 Gb and in contigs is 1.85 Gb.

Owing to the fragmentary nature of this preliminary assembly, it was 
necessary to arrange some scaffolds into "gene-scaffold" 
super-structures,in order to present complete genes. There are 4903 
such gene scaffolds, with identifiers of the form "GeneScaffold_1".

<i>Microcebus murinus</i> is one of 24 mammals that will be sequenced as part of the <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/">Mammalian Genome Project</a>, funded by the National Institutes of Health (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>).
 A group of species were chosen to maximise the branch length of the evolutionary tree while representing the diversity of mammalian species.

 Low-coverage 2X assemblies will be produced for these mammals and used in alignments for cross-species comparison.  The aim is to increase our understanding of functional elements, especially in the human genome.
