<p class="space-below">The <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> genome assembly 
<a href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Xentr4/Xentr4.home.html">version 4.1</a> 
[August 2005] is the fourth in a series of preliminary assembly releases by the 
JGI that are planned as part of the ongoing <i>X. tropicalis</i> genome project. 
This Ensembl website presents the sequence data provided by the JGI.</p>
         
<p>The reads were assembled using JAZZ, the JGI assembler, producing a genome of 
approximately 1.5 Gb. The assembly contains 19,501 scaffolds with an average coverage 
of 7.65X. Roughly half of the genome is contained in 272 scaffolds, all at least 1.56 Mb 
in length. In this update to the 4.0 assembly, some scaffolds showing homology to a 
known prokaryotic contaminant as well as non-cellular or vector contamination have 
been removed - see the JGI website (above) for more information.</p>
