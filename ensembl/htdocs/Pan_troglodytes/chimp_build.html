<h2>Chimp Genebuild</h2>
     
<p>Due to the high quality gene structure annotation of the human genome, 
and the high degree of similarity between the human and chimpanzee 
genomes, we have chosen to identify genes in chimpanzee by transfer of 
human genes to the corresponding location in chimp.</p>

<p>The protein-coding transcripts of the human gene structures are 
projected through the WGA onto the chromosomes in the chimp genome. 
Small insertions/deletions that disrupt the reading-frame of the 
resultant transcripts are corrected for by inserting "frame-shift" 
introns into the structure.</p>

<p>For some human exons and parts of exons, the corresponding chimp 
sequence is missing from the assembly. In most of these cases, the 
missing exon is omitted from the chimpanzee gene model. In a small 
number of cases however, where BLASTZ has aligned the human sequence to 
a gap in the chimp sequence, the exon is placed in the gap, resulting on 
a run of X's of the correct length in the translation.</p>

<p>Some human transcripts fail to transfer cleanly (due to, for example, 
missing alignment in the othologous regions). We have attempted to 
recover these using Exonerate. The single best exonerate alignment to 
chimp is chosen for each "missing" human transcript, and transcripts 
with less that 50% identity to the source or 50% coverage of the source 
are discarded.</p>
