<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p><img src="/img/species/pic_Pan_troglodytes.png" alt="chimpanzee" title="Oo ooo!" class="float-left" />This site provides a data set based on the March 
2006 Pan_troglodytes-2.1 6x shotgun assembly from the Chimpanzee Sequencing 
        Consortium headed by the <a href="http://www.genome.wustl.edu/gsc/">GSC</a> (St. Louis) and <a href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/">The Broad Institute</a> (MIT).</p>  
   
<p>The chimpanzee 2.1 assembly is a merge of the initial  4X made in 
collaboration with the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard and an 
additional (2X) whole genome coverage from the WUGSC (St. Louis) 
utilizing a combination of whole genome plasmid reads as well as fosmid 
and BAC end sequences.</p>
 
<p>This release of the assembly has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>246876 contigs, having N50 length 30.8 Kb</li>
	<li>contig length total 2.92 Gb</li>
	<li>chromosome length total 3.35 Gb</li>
</ul>

<h4>Chromosome numbering</h4>

<p>As of Release 35 we have changed the chimpanzee chromosome
numbering to match the new primate standard proposed by E.H. McConkey 
(<em>Cytogenetics and Genome Research</em>, <strong>105</strong>:157-158) 
and endorsed by the International Chimpanzee Genome Consortium.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>

<p>The genome was aligned to human NCBI36 by UCSC using BLASTz. These 
alignments were used to transfer human ensembl gene structures (Human 
Build 36b) to chimpanzee.
94% of the genes were mapped by direct projection while only 0,1% of the 
human ensembl genes were not mapped, the remaining 5.9% were aligned 
directly into the chimpanzee genome by using Exonerate (G. Slater et 
al., <i>BMC Bioinformatics.</i> 2005 6:31).</p>
