<h1>Public trackhubs</h1>

<p>Ensembl now provides support for trackhubs (also known as datahubs),
which are an alternative to DAS for sharing large quantities of annotation
over the internet. We do not host these trackhubs ourselves, but a list of
publicly accessible hubs is given below. Just click on a 
link to attach the hub to the appropriate species' 
Region in detail view.</p>

<p>If you wish to use a hub not on our list, please see our online
<a href="adding_trackhubs.html">instructions on how to attach a hub</a>.</p>


<div class="info-box">
<p>Please note that tracks are not turned on by default, as there
can be thousands in a hub. The link will open the control panel at
the correct menu, where you can turn on individual tracks.</p>
<p><b>Remote hubs may be slow to load or unavailable</b>.</p>
</div>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Datahubs on older assemblies have links to Ensembl archives where this functionality is available.</p>
