<h1>Public Track Hubs</h1>

<p>Ensembl now provides support for track hubs, 
which are an alternative to DAS for sharing large quantities of annotation
over the internet. We do not host these track hubs ourselves, but 
the new Track Hub Registry lists many available hubs for a wide variety of
species.</p>

<div class="info-box">
[[SCRIPT::EnsEMBL::Web::Document::HTML::TrackHubRegistry]]
</div>

<p>If you wish to use a hub not listed in the registry, please see our
<a href="adding_trackhubs.html">instructions on how to attach a hub</a>.</p>
