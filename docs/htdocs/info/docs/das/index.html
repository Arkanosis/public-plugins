<h1>DAS</h1>

<h2>The Distributed Annotation System (DAS)</h2>

<p>
DAS is a specification of a protocol for requesting and returning
annotation data for genomic regions. DAS allows sequence annotation to
be stored in a decentralised manner, by multiple third-party
annotators, and integrated on an as-needed basis by client-side
software.
</p>

<div class="info-box">
<p>As of release 84, Ensembl no longer supports the DAS protocol.
If you wish to make your data publicly accessible, we recommend
creating a track hub, which provides a similar service to DAS but 
requires only a standard web server (or ftp site) and a few simple 
configuration files.</p>
<p><a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html">Information on how to create a track hub</a>
can be found at the UCSC Genome Browser website. The track hub format
was created by the browser team at UCSC.</p>
