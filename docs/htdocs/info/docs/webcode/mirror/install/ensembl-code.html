<h1>Installing the Ensembl and BioPerl modules</h1>

<p>If you review the Site Structure part of this document, you will recall that the site is based around a
single server-root directory. The Ensembl and BioPerl modules are all installed into this
directory.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: we no longer recommend installing BioMart as part of your Ensembl site.
We have had to hack the code to integrate it, and our hacks are not in public CVS. If you would like to
use BioMart, we suggest either linking to a public BioMart or, for your own data, setting up a BioMart
instance using the new standalone Tomcat-based interface, available from 
<a href="http://www.biomart.org/">biomart.org</a> (currently version 0.8, rc6).</p>

<p>Choose a suitable location, and create your server-root directory. For the purposes of
illustration, we will use /usr/local/ensembl. When following these instructions, replace /usr/local/ensembl 
with your chosen server-root.</p>

<div class="tinted-box">
<p><b>Important notice</b>: As of Release 75 we have moved development into git. Releases up to and 
including version 77 are still available from CVS, but future releases will be git-only. Please see our 
<a href="http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2013/12/18/ensembl-has-migrated-to-git/">blog</a> 
for more information.</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li>Go to the server-root directory:
<code>cd /usr/local/ensembl</code>
</li>

<li id="cvs_co"><strong>Install the Ensembl modules</strong>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Clone Ensembl git tools from GitHub</p>
  <pre class="code">
$ git clone https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-git-tools.git
$ export PATH=$PWD/ensembl-git-tools/bin:$PATH
</pre>
  </li>
  <li><p>To check out the most recent stable version of the ensembl API and web code from GitHub you need to use the latest branch of the code. This will be set as the default branch in GitHub.</p> 
  <pre class="code">
$ git ensembl --clone public-web
</pre>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>N.B. You can also <a href="https://github.com/Ensembl" rel="external">view the Ensembl GitHub repository</a> in your web browser.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Install the core BioPerl modules</strong> - see <a href="/info/docs/api/api_git.html">API installation documentation</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>A listing of your server-root should now look something like:</p>
  <pre>
bioperl-live
ensembl
ensembl-compara
ensembl-funcgen
ensembl-git-tools
ensembl-io
ensembl-orm
ensembl-tools
ensembl-variation
ensembl-webcode
public-plugins</pre>

</li>
</ol>

<p>You should now have all the Ensembl website code and data installed and ready to configure.</p>
