<h1>Ensembl Tools</h1>

<p>We provide a number of ready-made tools for processing both our data (Biomart
        and the Virtual machine) and yours. For the latter:
 <ul>
        <li>The VEP processes jobs via a ticketing system and can handle
          medium to large files (up to 50Mb).</li>
        <li>For other jobs, only small datasets of up to 5Mb can be uploaded and
          processed online. We aim to extend the ticketing system used for VEP to these tools.</li>
        <li>For larger datasets we provide an API script that can be downloaded
          (you will also need to <a href="/info/docs/api/">install our Perl
            API</a> to use these).</li>
      </ul>
